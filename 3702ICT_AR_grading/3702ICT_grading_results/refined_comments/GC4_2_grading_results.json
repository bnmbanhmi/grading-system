    "comment": "The video offers a compelling demonstration of your augmented reality navigation system. The way you've integrated the AR overlays, like the virtual footsteps and text instructions, into the real-world footage makes the guidance feel quite intuitive. The mini-map in the corner is a nice touch that further enhances the user experience. Assuming the transitions are smooth and the voice-over is clear, the video's structure and flow should effectively showcase the system's functionality and provide a high-quality user experience."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 12.4,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates a high level of quality, particularly in its modular design. The clear separation of concerns across multiple scripts is a great approach for Unity projects. Your use of namespaces, `[Tooltip]` attributes, and well-placed XML comments (`/// <summary>`) is commendable, making the code very readable and maintainable, both in the editor and within the codebase itself. The effective use of core Unity patterns (Awake, Start, Update, Coroutines), along with the robust integration of external libraries like Mapbox and ARLocation, is also well done. The `Hotspot` and `DirectionsFactory` scripts are particularly well-structured and thoroughly commented. A couple of minor areas to consider for future refinement: you have two loading panel scripts (`LoadingPanelController` and `LoadingGamePanel`) that are quite similar; perhaps they could be refactored into a single utility or their subtle differences clarified. Also, the naming of `TouchInput1` and `TouchInput2` could be more descriptive of their specific functionalities. Overall, the consistency, structure, and comprehensive commenting are exceptionally strong, reflecting a high standard of coding practice."

      "score": 8.8,
      "comment": "The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of your AR application within the context of the project's aims. The problem statement, project aims, scope, and specific goals are clearly articulated. The high-level architecture diagram, detailed list of key features, and user interaction flow are exceptionally well-described, effectively connecting the design to the system's objectives. The technologies you've used are also clearly identified and justified, demonstrating a solid understanding of the project's foundation and purpose."

      "component": "2. XR/Game Dev Process",
      "score": 8.8,
      "comment": "The documentation presents a detailed account of your development process. Your choice of the Agile Scrum methodology is well-explained, along with its application through iterative development cycles, including sprint planning, implementation, testing, review, and refinement. The specific tools you used for collaboration, such as GitHub, Trello, Discord, and Zoom, are explicitly mentioned, demonstrating practical application. The breakdown into distinct development phases, coupled with a candid discussion of the challenges you faced and the solutions you implemented, showcases a robust and thoughtful approach to development. Your version control strategy is also well-articulated, highlighting a high standard of applied processes."

      "component": "3. Demo of Individual Element/Levels",
      "score": 17.7,
      "comment": "The documentation offers a detailed \"demo\" of individual components and their integration into the overall application. The 'System Design & Implementation' section meticulously describes core functionalities like AR setup and tracking, virtual pathway generation, Mapbox integration, Points of Interest (POI) management, and UI/UX design. For each element, the document explains not only its function but also the underlying technical implementation, referencing elements like AR Foundation, ARLocation, DirectionsFactory, Mapbox SDK, and custom classes. This level of technical depth and explanation of how components interact demonstrates a thorough understanding and successful integration of all elements into a high-fidelity prototype."

      "component": "4. Testing",
      "score": 8.8,
      "comment": "The testing section outlines a comprehensive strategy. It details various types of testing performed, including unit, integration, and performance testing, providing specific examples for each. Crucially, it includes a well-defined User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase with clear participant descriptions and scenarios. The explicit discussion of Verification & Validation (V&V) and how user feedback led to tangible improvements, such as UI adjustments and performance optimizations, demonstrates a rigorous approach to ensuring both functional correctness and alignment with user needs. The key findings and improvements section further validates the effectiveness of your testing process."

      "score": 4.4,
      "comment": "The asset register is comprehensive and well-organized, presented in a clear Excel format. It meticulously lists both external and internal assets across two separate sheets. For each asset, it accurately provides the name, type, description, clear source/origin (e.g., 'Created by Group 4 in Blender,' 'Royalty-Free Audio,' specific SDKs), and relevant licensing information. This demonstrates a thorough and accurate accounting of all project assets, meeting all requirements for a well-executed asset register."
