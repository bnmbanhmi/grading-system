    "comment": "The video offers a professional and well-organized demonstration of your 'Marker Based Navigator' system. I particularly appreciated the clear section titles, starting with a solid overview and moving into the specifics of the marker design. The live demonstrations of both standard and accessible navigation, showing the physical marker scanning and AR overlays, really highlight a functional and robust system. The inclusion and clear explanation of the 'Badges' feature further showcase a comprehensive implementation with added functionality. Overall, the structure, clear visuals, and evident demonstration of a well-implemented system make for an excellent and professional video."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 12.6,
    "comment": "The code exhibits excellent structure and modularity, with a clear separation of concerns across the various Unity scripts. Your use of XML documentation comments for classes, fields, and public methods is extensive and greatly aids readability and maintainability. I also noticed the consistent use of `[Tooltip]` attributes for serialized fields, which enhances usability within the Unity Editor. Naming conventions are consistently applied (e.g., `m_` prefix for private fields). The code effectively utilizes Unity-specific features, event handling, and conditional compilation. While there are a few minor areas for refinement (e.g., some hardcoded dictionary keys, reliance on deprecated APIs in certain scripts), the overall quality is very high, demonstrating a strong grasp of C# and Unity best practices."
