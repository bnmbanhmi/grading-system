    "comment": "The video does a nice job showcasing a functional AR game system, and I appreciate the clear user interface and engaging interactive elements you've included. The consistent pixel-art aesthetic across the AR overlays and UI really ties things together, and the dynamic dialogue, character interactions, and quiz feature demonstrate a well-implemented application. The progression of scenes suggests a clear and logical structure to the video itself, which professionally presents the system's capabilities. Assuming the transitions are smooth and the audio/voice-over is supportive, this presentation should be quite effective."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 12.8,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent structure and modularity; it's clear you've put thought into how the different components interact. The classes are well-defined with specific responsibilities, and the file headers provide helpful descriptions. I also noticed the consistent naming conventions, which adhere to C# and Unity standards. The use of ScriptableObjects for data definition is a great choice for clean data separation and editor workflow, and the Singleton patterns appear to be correctly implemented across various managers with `DontDestroyOnLoad`. Your use of Unity interfaces and event systems is also well-executed. A couple of minor points to consider for future improvement: using `FindObjectOfType` for singletons instead of directly accessing their `Instance` property can be less efficient, and the use of 'magic strings' for scene names in the `UIManager` could be improved with serialized fields or const variables. Overall, the code is very high quality, demonstrating strong architectural choices and clean implementation."

      "component": "XR/Game App Overview",
      "score": 8.2,
      "comment": "The documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the XR/Game application. You've clearly articulated the project's purpose – a gamified approach to wayfinding on campus – along with its core features, and how it aligns with the project's objectives. I particularly appreciate how you've contextualized the project within the existing university wayfinding challenges; it demonstrates a solid understanding of the problem space."

      "component": "XR/Game Dev Process",
      "score": 8.2,
      "comment": "The documentation details an iterative and agile development process, which is great to see. You've not only outlined the key phases – planning, design, implementation, testing – but also provided specific examples and tools used at each stage. The inclusion of Figma wireframe screenshots, details on AR Foundation implementation, and the discussion of custom system development for dialogue and quest logic provides strong evidence of a robust and well-applied development methodology."

      "component": "Demo of Individual Element/Levels",
      "score": 16.5,
      "comment": "The documentation effectively showcases individual elements and levels of the high-fidelity prototype. Each core feature – including AR wayfinding with the dynamic compass, interactive characters with dialogue, gamified quests/puzzles, and persistent progression – is clearly described and supported by relevant, high-quality in-app screenshots. This gives a strong visual understanding of their functionality and excellent integration within the overall application."

      "component": "Testing",
      "score": 8.2,
      "comment": "The testing section is well done, detailing a comprehensive strategy that includes unit, integration, and user acceptance testing (UAT). The concrete examples of unit tests and the mention of feedback from users, along with screenshots of bug reports, provide strong evidence of UAT. This demonstrates a thorough approach to validation and verification, and it's clear that testing was actively used to refine the prototype."

      "component": "Asset Register",
      "score": 4.6,
      "comment": "The asset register is exceptionally comprehensive and well-organized, both in the presentation and in the detailed Excel document. It accurately lists all assets, including their type, detailed description, source, license/permissions, file path, and specific usage within the project. This demonstrates excellent documentation practices and provides complete transparency regarding asset provenance and rights."
