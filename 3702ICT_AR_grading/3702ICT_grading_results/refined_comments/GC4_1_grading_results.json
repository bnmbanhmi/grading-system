    "score": 24.6,
    "comment": "The video offers a compelling and professional demonstration of your augmented reality navigation system. The AR elements, such as the footpath overlays, directional text, and integrated mini-map, are consistently presented and effectively highlight the system's capabilities. The visual quality is high, and the system appears stable in its real-time tracking and rendering. The progression through the waypoint mission is clearly shown, suggesting a well-thought-out structure and flow. Assuming smooth transitions, a helpful voice-over, and appropriate sound design, this video is a first-rate demonstration of the system."
