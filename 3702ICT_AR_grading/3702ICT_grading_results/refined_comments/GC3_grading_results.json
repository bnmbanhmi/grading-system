    "comment": "The video offers a compelling and professional demonstration of your AR system. I particularly liked the split-screen approach; it's a very effective way to showcase both the user's interaction with the real world and the augmented reality view on the device simultaneously. The AR navigation system appears quite robust, functioning well in both outdoor and indoor environments, with clear path indicators and instructions. The application's user interface is clean and well-designed, highlighting a comprehensive set of features, including user profiles, challenge tracking, social interactions, and even a points-based shop with themes. Overall, it suggests a well-implemented system with good functionality and a clear, well-structured presentation."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 8.4,
    "comment": "Your code demonstrates good modularity, with individual scripts clearly responsible for specific tasks, such as managing screen transitions, handling player data, and controlling UI themes. The use of `[SerializeField]` for Unity component references and `[Header]` for inspector organization is a nice touch. Error handling, using `Debug.LogError` for missing references, is also well-implemented. To further enhance your code, consider adding more detailed comments to explain the purpose of classes, complex methods, and design choices; class-level comments, in particular, would be beneficial. Also, keep an eye out for minor inconsistencies, such as the differing rotation methods in `ARDirectionalArrow` and `ARUIArrow`. You might also explore opportunities to consolidate duplicated logic, like the `SetButtonColor` method and CanvasGroup fading, into a reusable utility. Finally, while using `FindObjectOfType` can work, consider explicit assignments in the editor for better performance. Overall, the code is functional, well-structured at a high level, and follows common Unity patterns, making it suitable for its purpose. Addressing these minor points and enhancing commenting would elevate its quality even further."
