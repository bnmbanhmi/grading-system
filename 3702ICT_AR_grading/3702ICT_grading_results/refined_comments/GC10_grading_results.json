    "comment": "The video presentation gives us a good look at the Unity-based system, showcasing the airplane navigating the 3D environment. The screen recording is clear, which is helpful. However, the demonstration is noticeably affected by some robustness and visual glitches within the Unity scene. For example, the abrupt appearance and disappearance of black blocks, and potential collision or rendering issues, do impact the overall polish. While I appreciate that voice-over and smooth transitions were intended to enhance the presentation, these visual fidelity issues do detract from the final result."

      "score": 8.0,
      "comment": "This submission provides a clear and consistent overview of your gamified AR wayfinding application. I appreciate how you've connected the unique \"flying plane\" design concept to the system's goal of helping users navigate the campus, and you've effectively detailed its core functionalities and target audience."

      "component": "XR/Game Dev Process",
      "score": 6.0,
      "comment": "The documentation outlines a reasonable iterative development process, with distinct stages from initial concept to testing and documentation. While I see that you've used tools like Unity and AR Foundation, the description could benefit from more concrete examples of how these practices were applied and integrated during implementation. Also, the mention of version control is currently quite brief."

      "component": "Demo of Individual Element/Levels",
      "score": 15.0,
      "comment": "The documentation clearly defines and details many key components of your XR/Game application. This includes the AR environment setup, the plane model integration, the custom movement mechanics, the target and navigation system (with specific script functionalities), and the user interface elements. It's helpful how you explain how these individual components are designed to integrate and function together within the application's intended high-fidelity prototype."

      "component": "Testing",
      "score": 7.0,
      "comment": "The documentation presents a good overview of your testing procedures, including structured unit testing for key scripts, integration testing for component interactions, and user acceptance testing conducted by peers. The identification of specific issues during testing shows a practical application of these procedures."

      "component": "Asset Register",
      "score": 4.0,
      "comment": "The asset register is well-organized, categorizing key assets like 3D models, UI elements, and custom scripts. You've accurately identified their sources (e.g., Unity Asset Store, self-created) and included license information where relevant, demonstrating a mostly complete approach to asset documentation."
