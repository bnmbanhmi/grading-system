    "comment": "The video presents a highly professional and well-structured demonstration of the 'Marker Based Navigator' system. It effectively utilizes clear section titles, beginning with a comprehensive overview and progressing to detailed aspects such as marker design. The live demonstrations of both regular and accessible navigation, showcasing physical marker scanning and AR overlays, provide strong evidence of a working and robust system. The inclusion and clear presentation of the 'Badges' feature further demonstrate a comprehensive implementation with additional functionality. The overall structure, clear visuals, and evident demonstration of a well-implemented system contribute to an excellent and professional video presentation."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 12.6,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent structure and modularity, with clear separation of concerns across different Unity scripts. The use of XML documentation comments for classes, fields, and public methods is extensive and highly beneficial for readability and maintainability. `[Tooltip]` attributes are consistently used for serialized fields, enhancing usability within the Unity Editor. Naming conventions are consistent (e.g., `m_` prefix for private fields). The code effectively utilizes Unity-specific features, event handling, and conditional compilation. While there are a few minor areas for refinement (e.g., some hardcoded dictionary keys, reliance on deprecated APIs in certain scripts), the overall quality is very high, showing a strong understanding of C# and Unity best practices."
