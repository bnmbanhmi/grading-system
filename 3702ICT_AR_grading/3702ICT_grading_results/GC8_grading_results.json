    "comment": "The video frames demonstrate an excellent and professional presentation of the 'Griffith AR Wayfinder' application. The clear initial screen sets the context, followed by a well-designed UI for selecting destinations and difficulty levels. The core AR navigation functionality is showcased extensively, with a large, clear blue arrow guiding the user through the real-world environment, along with a timer and mode indicators. This indicates a high-quality system demonstration with robust AR integration. The logical progression from setup to live demonstration and a concluding screen suggests a great structure and flow. Assuming smooth transitions and the presence of a professional voice-over and sound, the overall presentation reaches a high standard of professionalism and clarity."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 10.4,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates good modularity with clear separation of concerns across different scripts (e.g., GameManager, DestinationManager, UI handlers, navigation logic). The use of the Singleton pattern for persistent managers (GameManager, NavigationState, DestinationManager) is implemented correctly with `DontDestroyOnLoad`. Naming conventions and general formatting are consistent.\n\nAreas for improvement include:\n*   **Commenting:** While some comments are present, they could be more comprehensive, especially for complex calculations (e.g., in `GPS_Integration`). The presence of many commented-out `Debug.Log` statements and entire commented-out scripts (`DifficultyButtonManager`, older `DestinationManager`) suggests a need for better code hygiene, potentially through more rigorous version control practices or refactoring/removal of dead code.\n*   **Magic Numbers:** Several 'magic numbers' are hardcoded (e.g., arrow scaling, distances, timer values, puzzle piece counts). Exposing these as serialized fields or defining them as constants would improve configurability and readability."

      "score": 7.5,
      "comment": "The document provides an excellent and comprehensive overview of the 'Griffith AR Wayfinder' application, clearly defining the project's purpose, scope, and objectives. The SMART objectives are well-articulated, mapping directly to the system's design and features within the context of campus wayfinding."

      "score": 6.7,
      "comment": "The document clearly outlines an Agile development process with Scrum principles, detailing each phase from planning to deployment. It highlights iterative sprints, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews, demonstrating a good understanding of development methodologies and tools. While it describes the process well, providing more concrete examples of how specific challenges were addressed or how user stories evolved through sprints would further enhance the 'detailed examples of applied processes' aspect."

      "score": 15.0,
      "comment": "The documentation provides a strong description and breakdown of the individual components of the 'Griffith AR Wayfinder' application, including detailed explanations of the GPS, AR, UI, and Game Elements modules. The user flowcharts, UI mockups, and descriptions of gamification and navigation logic clearly articulate how these elements function and integrate seamlessly within the application, reflecting the robust AR integration observed in the demo video."

      "component": "Testing",
      "score": 6.7,
      "comment": "The documentation demonstrates a good understanding of testing and validation, covering unit, integration, user acceptance, and AR-specific testing. The inclusion of clear test case examples with expected results, particularly for AR navigation accuracy, indicates a structured approach to functional self-testing and V&V. To achieve 'complete validation coverage,' providing more detailed test results, bug reports, or comprehensive coverage metrics would be beneficial."
