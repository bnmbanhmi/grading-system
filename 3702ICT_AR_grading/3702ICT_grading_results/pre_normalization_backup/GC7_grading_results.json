    "comment": "The video effectively demonstrates a robust AR game system with a clear user interface and engaging interactive elements. The consistent pixel-art aesthetic for the AR overlays and UI, combined with dynamic dialogue, character interactions, and a quiz feature, showcases a well-implemented and functional application. The progression across the frames suggests a clear and logical video structure, professionally presenting the system's capabilities. Assuming smooth transitions and supportive audio/voice-over, the presentation is of high quality."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 14,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent structure and modularity, with classes clearly defined for specific responsibilities (e.g., managers, data objects, puzzle types). File headers provide good descriptions, and naming conventions are highly consistent (PascalCase for classes/public members, camelCase for private fields), adhering to C# and Unity standards. ScriptableObjects are used effectively for data definition, promoting clean data separation and editor workflow. Singleton patterns are correctly implemented across various managers with `DontDestroyOnLoad`. The use of Unity interfaces (`IPointerClickHandler`) and event systems is also well-executed.\n\nMinor points for improvement, preventing a perfect score, include: \n1. Using `FindObjectOfType` for singletons (e.g., `DialogueManager.Instance` or `CompassController.Instance`) instead of directly accessing their `Instance` property, which can be less efficient and potentially lead to issues if the singleton isn't awake yet.\n2. The use of 'magic strings' for scene names (`\"ARPlayground\"`) in `UIManager`, which could be improved with `[SerializeField]` fields or `const` variables for better maintainability.\n\nOverall, the code is very high quality, demonstrating strong architectural choices and clean implementation."

      "component": "XR/Game App Overview",
      "score": 9,
      "comment": "The documentation provides an excellent and comprehensive overview of the XR/Game application. It clearly articulates the project's purpose (gamified wayfinding on campus), core features, and how it aligns with the project's objectives. The context of existing university wayfinding challenges and the proposed solution is well-articulated, demonstrating a deep understanding of the problem space."

      "score": 9,
      "comment": "The documentation details an excellent iterative and agile development process. It not only outlines the key phases (planning, design, implementation, testing) but also provides specific examples and tools used at each stage. The inclusion of Figma wireframe screenshots, details on AR Foundation implementation, and the discussion of custom system development (dialogue, quest logic) provides strong evidence of a robust and well-applied development methodology."

      "component": "Demo of Individual Element/Levels",
      "score": 18,
      "comment": "The documentation effectively showcases individual elements and levels of the high-fidelity prototype. Each core feature – including AR wayfinding with dynamic compass, interactive characters with dialogue, gamified quests/puzzles (e.g., quizzes), and persistent progression – is clearly described and supported by relevant, high-quality in-app screenshots. This provides a strong visual understanding of their functionality and excellent integration within the overall application."

      "component": "Testing",
      "score": 9,
      "comment": "The testing section is excellent, detailing a comprehensive strategy that includes unit, integration, and user acceptance testing (UAT). Concrete examples of unit tests (e.g., DialogueManagerTests, QuizManagerTests) are provided, and strong evidence of UAT is presented through the mention of feedback from 10 users and screenshots of bug reports. This demonstrates a thorough approach to validation and verification, indicating that testing was actively used to refine the prototype."

      "score": 5,
      "comment": "The asset register is exceptionally comprehensive and well-organized, provided both as a summary in the presentation and in a detailed Excel document. It accurately lists all assets, including their type, detailed description, source, license/permissions, file path, and specific usage within the project. This demonstrates excellent documentation practices and provides complete transparency regarding asset provenance and rights."
