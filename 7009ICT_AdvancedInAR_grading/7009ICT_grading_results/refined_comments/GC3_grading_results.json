    "comment": "This is an excellent video presentation; the clarity and structure really allow the prototype's core functionalities to shine. The augmented reality scanning feature is particularly well-showcased, effectively displaying the 3D product models, nutritional information, and allergy warnings. You've covered key features thoroughly, including login/logout, user condition selection, AR product scanning, related products, and the reward system. Assuming the transitions are smooth and the audio with voice-over is of high quality, as per the instructions, the overall production quality is strong, providing a comprehensive and engaging overview of the application."

    "score": 13.5,
    "comment": "Overall, the code is of high quality, demonstrating a strong grasp of best practices in Unity development through its excellent structure, readability, and modularity. The use of Unity patterns (coroutines, singletons like PopupManager and CartManager, lifecycle methods), robust error handling (e.g., in ARBarcodeScanner, AuthManager, CouponManager), and effective management of persistent data (UserData, image saving in ScanSceneController) are all quite evident. The AR-specific components, including barcode scanning, model spawning, and UI interaction for 3D models, are thoughtfully and cleanly implemented, effectively handling user input and external API calls. However, there's an area for improvement in the `GetRecommendations` coroutine within `ProductModel.cs`. The direct access of `lowerCalProducts[0]`, `[1]`, and `[2]` without checking for sufficient elements in the list could lead to an `IndexOutOfRangeException` and a runtime crash if fewer than three lower-calorie products are found. While this doesn't impact the core AR scanning or cart management, it's a significant stability issue for the recommendation feature, placing the code in the 'Good' category due to this moderate functional issue, despite its otherwise excellent qualities."

      "comment": "The presentation PDF is exceptionally well-structured, detailed, and comprehensive, clearly articulating the project's purpose and scope. The design rationale, including the system architecture and UI/UX with wireframes and mockups, is well-explained, as is the structured development process using Agile Scrum. Your documentation of challenges, risk management, and future enhancements demonstrates a strong understanding of project lifecycle management. The technical detail provided regarding AR implementation, API integration, and performance considerations is impressive, indicating a robust and well-planned project."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 8.4,
      "comment": "The team has provided excellent and comprehensive documentation detailing individual contributions, roles, and responsibilities across multiple project documents. The presentation document clearly defines team roles on Slide 2, assigning specific titles like 'Team Leader', 'Full Stack Developer', and 'Project Manager', further elaborating with detailed responsibilities for each team member on Slide 18. For example, it outlines specific responsibilities for each member, providing concrete examples of individual contributions. Furthermore, the asset register provides a clear breakdown of ownership for major project assets, assigning specific assets to individual team members in Column D, demonstrating a clear division of significant work components. Finally, the test and validation document further solidifies the evidence of individual contribution and balanced workload, explicitly listing individual team members responsible for specific test cases across various functionalities in Column E, indicating a well-balanced workload in the testing phase. Overall, the evidence is clear, consistent, and highly specific, demonstrating well-defined roles, significant individual contributions, and an evident balanced workload across the team."
