    "comment": "The video you've put together offers a clear and engaging demonstration of your prototype, effectively showcasing its key features and AR functionality. The visuals are well-produced, with smooth transitions between the in-editor views and the real-world AR demonstrations. I particularly appreciated the use of clear text overlays to highlight the features being presented. Assuming the addition of a voice-over and sound further enhances the presentation, the overall production quality appears quite high, making it an excellent demonstration of the prototype's capabilities."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 11.7,
    "comment": "Your code demonstrates a solid grasp of Unity development practices and C# fundamentals. Many of the individual scripts, especially those adapted from Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit and AR Foundation samples, are well-structured, readable, and follow best practices, showcasing effective use of coroutines, event handling, and Unity-specific attributes. The custom scripts you've created also appear well-implemented and functional. However, there are some areas where improvements in code organization and modularity would be beneficial. For instance, several simple animation scripts contain nearly identical logic, suggesting an opportunity to refactor these into a single, more generic and reusable animation controller class. Additionally, the functionality of one script largely overlaps with another, and consolidating these would be advantageous. Finally, the submission's file structure suggests a need for improved organization within the original project. Addressing these organizational and redundancy issues would significantly enhance the overall quality and professional appeal of the codebase."

      "score": 16.0,
      "comment": "The presentation document comprehensively articulates the project's purpose, design rationale, and development process. It effectively covers the AR Claw Machine concept, target audience, core features, design philosophy, and technical implementation, as well as the agile development process. The presentation also details the challenges you faced and the solutions you implemented, along with possibilities for future enhancements. The slides are well-structured, professional, and contain strong technical detail. Considering the previous assessment's comment on the video's engaging demonstration and high production quality, it's evident that the delivery was excellent. The detailed content suggests a strong understanding and confident approach to the material."

      "score": 8.2,
      "comment": "The team has provided exceptionally clear and detailed evidence of individual contributions across multiple project files. The presentation document clearly outlines team roles and elaborates on specific responsibilities for each member. Furthermore, the readme document extensively details individual contributions, reiterating the core responsibilities and providing a very specific list of tasks performed by each team member, including specific programming aspects, 3D assets created, and project management duties. The mention of individual branches for tasks in the Git workflow also implicitly supports a structured division of labor and individual accountability. This comprehensive level of detail unequivocally demonstrates that each team member's role was significant, their contributions were well-defined with specific examples, and the workload appears well-distributed and balanced."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 7.8,
      "comment": "The readme document provides an exceptionally thorough and well-documented testing methodology. It explicitly outlines various testing methods, including Unit Testing, Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing, Performance Testing, AR Environment Testing, and Device Compatibility Testing. The validation section clearly articulates how functionality, performance, user experience, and tracking stability were confirmed. While raw test results are not included, the detailed description of methods and validation points demonstrates a strong commitment to ensuring the application's quality and stability. The presentation also supports this by mentioning benchmarking and profiling strategies."

      "score": 4.3,
      "comment": "The asset register is an exemplary piece of documentation. It is complete, meticulously organized, and clearly documents all project assets. For each asset, it provides the name, type, source/creator, usage in the project, and crucial licensing/attribution information. This includes not only external assets but also Unity's own XR Interaction Toolkit and custom scripts, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes a project asset. The level of detail and organization is truly commendable."
