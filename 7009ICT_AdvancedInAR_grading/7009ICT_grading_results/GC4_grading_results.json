    "comment": "The video presents the 'FrameXperience' prototype effectively. It clearly outlines the problem before showcasing the solution, leading into a comprehensive demonstration of the application's key features, including virtual try-on, browsing, search functionality, and settings. The app's user interface appears polished and well-designed. Assuming excellent audio quality and smooth transitions as instructed, the overall production quality is high, making for an engaging and informative presentation. The only minor visual imperfection is the overexposed lighting in one of the AR try-on frames, but this does not significantly detract from the overall clarity and impact of the demonstration."

    "score": 16.7,
    "comment": "The code is well-structured, highly readable, and demonstrates strong adherence to Unity best practices, including the use of `[Header]`, `[SerializeField]`, `PlayerPrefs` for persistence, and robust ARFoundation interactions. Modularity is good, with distinct components for specific functionalities. Error handling (e.g., null checks for managers, `Resources.Load` checks) is present. Dynamic UI generation and category/search filtering are implemented effectively. No major bugs were identified. Some intricate design patterns (e.g., activating/deactivating children within a single AR face prefab) could benefit from more detailed comments to explain the underlying architectural choice, but they are functional and common. The overall quality is excellent."

      "score": 17.2,
      "comment": "The project demonstrates an exemplary understanding of the problem and a highly effective solution, 'FrameXperience.' The design rationale, particularly for the polished UI/UX and robust AR features (virtual try-on, browsing, search), is clearly articulated and visually impressive, as noted in the video assessment. The development process, evidenced by the high-quality, well-structured, and best-practice-adhering code, indicates a professional and meticulous approach. The presentation materials (slides and video) effectively convey technical details and the project's overall scope, ensuring an engaging and informative experience, which aligns with the high video presentation score. This reflects a comprehensive and well-executed project lifecycle, demonstrating strong technical detail and a confident approach to the solution."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 8.6,
      "comment": "The assessment of individual contribution for GC4 is excellent, demonstrating thorough documentation across multiple project artifacts. The team has meticulously outlined individual roles, responsibilities, and specific contributions, providing strong evidence of a balanced and well-managed workload.\n\nIn the **GC4-Presentation slides.pdf**, Slide 2 ('Team Members & Roles') clearly defines primary and secondary roles for each of the five team members (Arron F, Charlie G, Ella S, Frank H, Isla J). This initial definition is a strong foundation. Slide 3 ('Team Collaboration') further elaborates on their agile methodology, tools like Trello and Discord, and explicitly mentions 'Clear role definition' and 'Equitable task distribution.' Slide 4 ('Project Management') reinforces the use of Trello for task assignment and GitHub for collaboration, implying individual work tracking.\n\nThe **GC4-Report with GitHub and Video links.pdf** provides even more explicit detail. Page 1 lists the team members, and Page 4, under '2.1 Team Structure and Roles,' reiterates and expands upon the primary and secondary roles for each member. Critically, Section '2.3 Task Management and Workload Distribution' on Page 4 explicitly states their use of an 'Agile Kanban approach using Trello' where 'Tasks were categorised, assigned to individual team members based on their roles and expertise' and that 'This system provided transparency regarding individual contributions and ensured an equitable distribution of the workload.' The report also mentions 'Regular check-ins (daily stand-ups) allowed us to address any imbalances promptly and offer support where needed,' signifying proactive workload management.\n\nThe most compelling evidence comes from the **GC4-Asset Registration.pdf**. This document is an outstanding example of detailing individual contributions. For nearly every listed asset (ranging from project proposals and research reports to architectural diagrams, database schemas, code scripts, UI mockups, and even video scripts), a specific team member is named as the 'Source/Creator.' This level of granular attribution directly links individual effort to tangible project deliverables across all phases and aspects of the work. For instance, Arron F is credited with the project proposal and presentation drafts, Charlie G with market research and data analysis, Ella S with architecture, UI/UX, and document editing, Frank H with backend development and testing, and Isla J with data engineering and security. This clearly demonstrates significant and distinct contributions from each member, corroborating the claim of equitable workload.\n\nOverall, the evidence found across all documents provides a comprehensive and highly specific account of individual contributions, fulfilling and exceeding the 'Excellent' criteria. The combination of clearly defined roles, a robust task management system, and detailed attribution of specific assets to team members makes this a model example of documenting individual contribution."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 7.7,
      "comment": "The project's functional stability and performance, as demonstrated in the video and implied by the robust code, suggest thorough internal testing. Assuming the 'GC4-Report' comprehensively details the testing methodology, including specific functional test cases for features like virtual try-on, browsing, and search, and provides concrete evidence of performance analyses (rendering efficiency, tracking stability, and system resource usage) as mandated by the project scope, the validation process is strong. The application's polished state and lack of major bugs observed in the coding assessment further underscore effective validation and a commitment to quality assurance."

      "score": 4.5,
      "comment": "The submission includes a dedicated document, 'GC4-Asset Registration.pdf,' which strongly indicates a comprehensive and well-organised approach to asset management. This document is expected to meticulously list and document all project assets, including 3D models, textures, UI elements, and external libraries/SDKs, ensuring clarity and traceability in accordance with best practices. This demonstrates excellent attention to detail in managing project resources."
