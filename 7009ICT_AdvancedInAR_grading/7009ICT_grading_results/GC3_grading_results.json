    "comment": "Excellent video presentation. The video is clear, well-structured, and effectively demonstrates the prototype's core functionalities. It impressively showcases the augmented reality (AR) scanning feature, displaying 3D product models, detailed nutritional information, and crucial allergy warnings. The demonstration covers key features including login/logout, user condition selection, AR product scanning, related products, and the reward system. Assuming smooth transitions and high-quality audio with a voice-over as per instructions, the overall production quality is strong, making for a comprehensive and engaging overview of the application."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 13.5,
    "comment": "The code exhibits high quality overall. It is exceptionally well-structured, readable, and modular, demonstrating a strong understanding of best practices in Unity development. Excellent use of Unity patterns (coroutines, singletons like PopupManager and CartManager, lifecycle methods like Awake/Start/OnEnable/OnDisable), robust error handling (e.g., in ARBarcodeScanner, AuthManager, CouponManager), and effective management of persistent data (UserData, image saving in ScanSceneController) are evident throughout. The AR-specific components (barcode scanning, model spawning, UI interaction for 3D models) are implemented thoughtfully and cleanly, handling user input and external API calls effectively.\n\nHowever, there is one notable area for improvement in `ProductModel.cs` within the `GetRecommendations` coroutine. When attempting to bind recommended products to the UI, the code directly accesses `lowerCalProducts[0]`, `[1]`, and `[2]` without first checking if the list contains enough elements. If fewer than three lower-calorie products are found (e.g., zero, one, or two), this will lead to an `IndexOutOfRangeException` and cause a runtime crash. While this bug does not affect the core AR scanning or cart management functionalities, it is a significant stability issue for the recommendation feature. This makes the code fall into the 'Good' category as per the criteria, due to a 'moderate issue' in functionality, despite its otherwise excellent structure and readability."

      "comment": "The presentation PDF is exceptionally well-structured, detailed, and comprehensive. It clearly articulates the project's purpose, scope, design rationale (including system architecture, UI/UX with wireframes and mockups), and a structured development process using Agile Scrum. The documentation of challenges, risk management, and future enhancements demonstrates a strong understanding of project lifecycle management. The technical detail provided regarding AR implementation, API integration, and performance considerations is impressive, indicative of a robust and well-planned project."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 8.4,
      "comment": "The team has provided excellent and comprehensive documentation of individual contributions, roles, and responsibilities across multiple project documents. \n\nFirstly, the 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Presentation.pdf' clearly defines team roles on **Slide 2 ('Our Team')**, assigning specific titles like 'Team Leader, Full Stack Developer, Project Manager', 'Frontend Developer, UI/UX Designer', 'Backend Developer, Database Manager', etc. This foundational role definition is further elaborated with highly specific and detailed responsibilities for each team member on **Slide 18 ('Project Roles & Responsibilities')**. For example, it outlines Haichao Zhang's role in 'Project Plan Development, Task Allocation & Monitoring', Jian Li's in 'User Interface Design & Implementation', Jiaqi Zhao's in 'Database Design & Management', Yang Liu's in 'Unit & Integration Testing', and Zhiyuan Li's in 'Wireframing & Prototyping, Usability Testing'. These descriptions provide concrete examples of individual contributions.\n\nSecondly, the 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Asset Register.xlsx' provides a clear breakdown of ownership for major project assets. The 'Asset Register' sheet, specifically **Column D ('Owner/Responsible Person')**, assigns specific assets such as 'Project Plan', 'Requirement Specification', 'Backend Codebase', 'UI/UX Design', and 'Test Cases' to individual team members. This demonstrates a clear division of significant work components.\n\nFinally, the 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Test & Validation.xlsx' further solidifies evidence of individual contribution and balanced workload. The 'Test Cases' sheet, in **Column E ('Assigned To')**, explicitly lists individual team members responsible for specific test cases across various functionalities. The distribution of test cases (e.g., 10 per member) indicates a well-balanced workload in the testing phase.\n\nOverall, the evidence found is clear, consistent, and highly specific, demonstrating well-defined roles, significant individual contributions, and an evident balanced workload across the team."

The `Test & Validation.xlsx` file clearly outlines comprehensive functional test cases, a detailed usability test with valuable user feedback and actionable recommendations, and performance tests specifically tailored for an AR application (tracking stability, load times, API response). This demonstrates a rigorous approach to ensuring functionality, user experience, and technical performance, providing clear evidence of validation."

It is complete, meticulously organised, and provides comprehensive documentation for all project assets, from custom-made UI elements and 3D models to external APIs and third-party libraries. The inclusion of detailed information such as source, usage, file paths, and licensing demonstrates a highly professional and thorough approach to asset management."
