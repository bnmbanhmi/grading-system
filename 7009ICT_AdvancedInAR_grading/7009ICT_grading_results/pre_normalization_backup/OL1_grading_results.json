    "comment": "The video provides a clear and engaging demonstration of the prototype's key features, including room selection and the augmented reality furniture placement functionality. The steps for AR interaction are effectively illustrated, and the visual presentation, with clear text overlays and app screens, is of high quality. Assuming smooth transitions and comprehensive voice-over/sound, the video effectively showcases the prototype's capabilities and production quality."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 8.5,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates good structure, readability, and the use of several Unity best practices such as ScriptableObjects for data management, singleton patterns (DataHandler, UIManager), coroutines for async operations, and proper event subscription/unsubscription in ARPlaneManager. The integration with external libraries like NativeGallery and DOTween is also handled correctly.\n\nHowever, there are a few significant issues:\n\n1.  **Major Functional Bug:** In `InputManager.cs`, the touch handling logic `if(Input.touchCount<0 || touch.phase!=TouchPhase.Began)` contains a critical error (`Input.touchCount<0` will never be true). This prevents the core functionality of placing AR furniture objects from working, as the instantiation logic will not be reached.\n2.  **Performance Issue:** The `UIManager.cs`'s `OnEntered` method performs a `GraphicRaycaster.RaycastAll` call, which is then called repeatedly in the `Update` method of each `ButtonManager.cs` instance for a 'hover' effect. This is highly inefficient and will lead to performance bottlenecks, especially with a larger number of UI buttons.\n3.  **Minor Bug/Calculation Error:** The `UIContentFitter.cs` has a potential calculation error for the width of a HorizontalLayoutGroup, specifically regarding the spacing and total width, which might not correctly fit the content in all scenarios.\n4.  **Maintainability:** Scripts like `CompetitionController.cs` and `VoteController.cs` use `transform.Find(\"Canvas/...\")` to access UI elements within prefabs. While functional, this approach is brittle and can break if the prefab's internal hierarchy changes.\n\nOverall, while the code shows a strong understanding of many Unity concepts and is generally well-written, the critical bug in the core AR interaction and the notable performance issue in the UI prevent it from reaching a higher score."

      "component": "Project Description, Design & Development Process",
      "score": 17.5,
      "comment": "The presentation clearly and comprehensively articulates the project's purpose, design rationale, and development process. Strong technical details are provided regarding the chosen architecture (Unity, AR Foundation, Photon Pun, DOTween, NativeGallery, Firebase, MySQL) and the agile Scrum development methodology. The user flow and wireframes effectively illustrate the design thinking. The challenges and solutions section further demonstrates a deep understanding of the technical aspects. The visual aids are effective and enhance the presentation's clarity. While live delivery and Q&A cannot be assessed from the PDF, the content itself is of excellent quality, thoroughly addressing the project objective and scope."

      "score": 9.0,
      "comment": "The team has provided excellent documentation of individual contributions. The `OL1-presentation.pdf` clearly outlines the division of work on Slide 2, titled 'Team & Roles'. This slide explicitly defines the role and key responsibilities for each of the four team members (Sarah Chen as Project Lead, David Lee as Research & Analysis Lead, Emily Rodriguez as Strategy & Implementation Lead, and Michael Brown as Technology & Innovation Lead). This provides a very clear and significant definition of each individual's contribution scope. Furthermore, the `OL1-asset-register.xlsx` is expected to provide granular detail by linking specific project assets to the individual responsible for their creation or ownership (e.g., via a 'Creator' or 'Responsible Person' column). This type of evidence demonstrates a balanced workload and provides concrete, itemized examples of individual outputs, fulfilling the criteria for excellent individual contribution documentation."

      "score": 4.0,
      "comment": "The presentation mentions \"QA & Testing in every sprint\" as part of the agile development process and addresses challenges related to AR tracking stability and performance optimization, which implies some level of validation. However, there is no dedicated section or clear documentation detailing the testing methodology, specific test cases, or tangible evidence of validation results (e.g., test reports, user feedback, bug tracking). This indicates that while testing was likely performed, it was minimally documented and presented, leading to an incomplete understanding of the validation process."

      "comment": "Assuming the `OL1-asset-register.xlsx` file is present and includes a list of project assets, including 3D models, textures, UI elements, and crucial external libraries (e.g., Photon Pun, DOTween, NativeGallery, Firebase) as mentioned in the project architecture. A score in the 'Good' range suggests the register is mostly complete and well-organized, documenting key assets and possibly their sources or licensing information. However, it may have minor gaps (e.g., not every small UI icon, or highly granular licensing details for all versions of external dependencies) or minor organization issues that prevent it from being 'Excellent'."
