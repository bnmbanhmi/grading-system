    "comment": "The video provides a very clear and engaging demonstration of the 'AR Room Customizer' prototype. It effectively showcases key features such as adding, placing, and customizing items (including color changes), as well as wall and floor customization. The visual quality appears high, with sharp graphics and a well-designed user interface. Assuming the video includes a clear voice-over, good sound quality, and is within the specified time limit, and giving maximum allowance for smooth transitions as per instructions, this video meets the criteria for excellent presentation."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 11.7,
    "comment": "The code exhibits excellent structure, readability, and largely adheres to Unity best practices. Variables are consistently named, and the extensive use of `[Tooltip]` attributes significantly enhances editor usability. XML documentation comments are prevalent, contributing to clear API definitions.\n\nHowever, there is a notable logical bug in the `ObjectSpawner.cs` file. The `TrySpawnObject` method explicitly returns `false` if `m_SpawnOptionIndex` is out of range (which includes the `-1` value intended for randomization), directly contradicting the documented `isSpawnOptionRandomized` property and preventing the random spawning functionality from working as described. Additionally, the `ARTemplateMenuManager.cs` contains minor inconsistencies such as an incorrect warning message in `SetMaterialsToAdd` and a typo in the `mateialList` property name.\n\nThe overall quality, particularly in structure and readability, is high, but the presence of a significant functional bug prevents it from reaching an 'Excellent' rating. The .zip file organization and functionality could not be assessed."

      "comment": "The project's purpose and design rationale are very clearly articulated, aligning well with the project scope of enhancing business and consumer engagement. The video presentation (previously assessed with a high score) further reinforces the clarity and user-friendliness of the design, showcasing features like adding, placing, and customizing items, as well as wall and floor customization. The coding quality report indicates strong underlying structure, readability, and adherence to Unity best practices, suggesting a well-thought-out and professional development process. However, a minor deduction is made as the presentation content (as inferred from a PDF) might not fully delve into the 'in-depth analysis of rendering efficiency, tracking stability, and system resource usage' as per the project scope, and ideally, a professional development process would acknowledge or address the known logical bug found in the `ObjectSpawner.cs` file, even if it's a minor oversight in the broader context of the project. Overall, the content demonstrates a good understanding of the project and its development."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 5.4,
      "comment": "The team OL5 has provided clear evidence of individual contribution through well-defined roles for each team member. On Slide 2 of the 'ARRoomCustomizer Presentation.pdf', all five team members are listed with distinct leadership roles: Ahmad Al-Hamad as Team Leader, Lars Johannessen as Development Lead, Abdullah Al-Subaie as UI/UX Lead, Adam Hassen as Documentation Lead, and Mohammed Al-Mutairi as QA Lead. This explicit role definition demonstrates a structured approach to dividing responsibilities and ensures that each member has a clear area of ownership within the project. This is a strong indicator of individual contribution planning and accountability.\n\nHowever, the documentation does not provide further specific examples of individual contributions beyond these defined roles (e.g., 'Lars implemented X feature' or 'Abdullah designed Y interface'). There is also no explicit mention or evidence regarding the balance of workload across team members or individual reflection statements. While the roles are clearly identified and assigned, the absence of granular detail on what specific tasks or deliverables each individual was responsible for, or how the workload was distributed, prevents this from reaching the 'Excellent' category. Nevertheless, the complete and clear definition of roles for all members significantly exceeds the 'Satisfactory' criteria and aligns well with the 'Good' assessment, highlighting clear involvement and identifiable roles for every team member."

      "score": 3.3,
      "comment": "While the project demonstrates functional aspects in the video, the presence of a 'notable logical bug' in `ObjectSpawner.cs` (preventing random spawning functionality from working as described, despite being documented) significantly impacts the validation score. This indicates that the testing methodology, while likely covering basic functionality shown in the demo, was not thorough enough to catch a critical functional flaw, leading to incomplete validation of the prototype's intended features. Evidence of comprehensive testing results or detailed AR-specific performance analyses (e.g., tracking stability data, resource usage) is not apparent through the provided documentation, which would be crucial for a higher score in this section. The validation is incomplete due to the uncaught major bug."

It effectively lists and categorizes project assets, clearly documenting their source and usage, which is crucial for project maintainability and intellectual property management. This demonstrates excellent attention to detail in asset documentation and management, facilitating a clear overview of all resources used in the project."
