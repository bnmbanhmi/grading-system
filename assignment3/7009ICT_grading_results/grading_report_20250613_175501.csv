Student Name,XR DEVELOPMENT REPORT,Introduction & Reflection on Final Product,13.5,20.0,"The introduction provides a clear overview of the report's purpose. The reflection touches upon overall performance and development challenges, but could benefit from a more in-depth discussion of specific design decisions and the trade-offs considered during development."
Student Name,XR DEVELOPMENT REPORT,Methodology & Test Setup,7.5,15.0,"The methodology outlines the test setup, devices, and Unity tools used. To improve, consider providing more specific details on the testing environment, the rationale behind device selection, and a clearer step-by-step process for data collection."
Student Name,XR DEVELOPMENT REPORT,Performance Metrics Analysis,12.0,25.0,"Key performance metrics like FPS and memory are identified and presented, including some visual aids. However, the analysis could be more rigorous, offering deeper insights into the 'why' behind the numbers and correlating specific application features with observed performance spikes or drops."
Student Name,XR DEVELOPMENT REPORT,Comparative Analysis,9.0,20.0,"A basic comparison between devices/platforms is present. To enhance this section, focus on a more detailed comparative discussion of key performance indicators, highlighting significant differences and their potential causes, rather than just listing observations."
Student Name,XR DEVELOPMENT REPORT,"Discussion, Optimization & Conclusion",9.5,15.0,"The report offers relevant interpretations of findings and suggests some optimizations. However, the discussion of trade-offs for these optimizations could be more comprehensive. The conclusion effectively summarizes key takeaways but could offer a stronger forward-looking reflection."
Student Name,XR DEVELOPMENT REPORT,Report Structure & Clarity,3.5,5.0,"The report is generally well-structured with clear headings, making it easy to follow. The language is mostly clear, though some technical explanations could be refined for better precision. Ensure consistent formatting throughout."
