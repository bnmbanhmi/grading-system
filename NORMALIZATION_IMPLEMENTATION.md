# Score Normalization Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented AI-powered score normalization functionality for the AR Project Grading System. This feature adjusts grading results to meet specific institutional distribution requirements while maintaining evaluation integrity.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Core Functionality Added

#### `normalize_scores(client: genai.Client)` Function
- **Purpose**: Normalizes all grading results to meet target distribution (mean=65, range=55-90)
- **Process**:
  1. Loads all existing grading results from `grading_results/` directory
  2. Calculates current score distribution
  3. Determines if normalization is needed
  4. Creates backup of original scores
  5. Uses AI refinement to adjust individual scores
  6. Saves normalized results with metadata
  7. Verifies final distribution

#### `refine_scores_with_ai()` Function
- **Purpose**: Uses Gemini AI to intelligently adjust individual group scores
- **Features**:
  - Maintains evaluation integrity and educational feedback
  - Considers class distribution context
  - Provides detailed scoring guidelines to AI
  - Validates AI responses for proper structure and range
  - Returns refined assessment with adjusted scores and preserved comments

### 2. Menu System Enhancement
Updated main menu to include normalization option:
1. Interactive Mode
2. Batch Mode  
3. Export CSV Report
4. **Normalize Scores** (NEW)
5. Quit

### 3. Integration Points
- Integrated into main grading workflow
- Added handling in `main()` function
- Compatible with existing CSV export functionality
- Preserves all existing grading features

## Technical Features

### AI Integration
- Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview model
- Sophisticated prompt engineering for academic context
- Maintains assessment rationale while adjusting scores
- Considers institutional distribution requirements

### Data Safety
- **Automatic Backups**: Original scores saved to `pre_normalization_backup/` directory
- **Metadata Tracking**: Records normalization timestamp, original scores, and backup location
- **Validation**: Ensures AI-suggested scores are within acceptable ranges

### Distribution Algorithm
- **Target Requirements**: Mean=65, Highest≤90, Lowest≥55
- **Intelligent Adjustment**: Considers current distribution when adjusting individual scores
- **Proportional Changes**: Maintains relative quality differences between assessments

## Usage Workflow

### 1. Check Current Distribution
System automatically calculates and displays:
- Current mean, min, max scores
- Target distribution requirements
- Whether normalization is needed

### 2. AI-Powered Refinement
For each group:
- Analyzes current assessment components
- Determines adjustment direction based on class distribution
- Uses AI to refine scores while preserving feedback quality
- Validates results for consistency

### 3. Result Verification
- Updates all JSON grading files
- Displays before/after distribution statistics
- Provides backup location for recovery if needed

## Example Output

```
📊 Current Score Distribution:
   Mean: 77.5/100
   Range: 45 - 95

🎯 Target Score Distribution:
   Mean: 65/100
   Range: 55 - 90

⚙️ Normalization required. Processing 4 groups...

Processing 1/4: GC1
   ✓ Score adjusted: 95 → 87

Processing 2/4: GC2  
   ✓ Score adjusted: 45 → 58

📊 Final Score Distribution:
   Mean: 65.2/100 (target: 65)
   Range: 58 - 87 (target: 55-90)
   
✅ Normalization Complete!
📁 Backups saved to: grading_results/pre_normalization_backup/
```

## File Structure After Implementation

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the grader**: `python grader.py`
2. **Select option 4**: "Normalize Scores"
3. **Review current distribution**: System displays before/after statistics
4. **Confirm normalization**: AI processes each group's scores
5. **Verify results**: Check updated JSON files and backup directory

The implementation is complete and ready for use with the Gemini API key configuration.
