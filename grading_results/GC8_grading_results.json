    "comment": "The video effectively showcases the key features and functionality of the Pocket Golf AR prototype, demonstrating the user journey from app launch through gameplay to game completion. The AR aspect is well-highlighted and engaging. Assuming the video is within the time limit and includes a clear voice-over and good sound quality, it provides a comprehensive overview. A minor visual artifact was observed in one frame, which slightly impacts the overall production polish, but does not significantly impede the demonstration of the prototype's core gameplay and interactive elements."

    "score": 15.8,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent structure and modularity, with distinct scripts for well-defined functionalities. It is highly readable, employing clear naming conventions and consistent formatting throughout. The project adheres to many Unity best practices, including proper use of `[SerializeField]`, `RequireComponent`, `DontDestroyOnLoad` for singletons, and robust null checks. Complex systems like the `PathVisualizer`, with its Catmull-Rom spline implementation and dynamic collider generation, are well-engineered. The `GolfGameManager` effectively manages game state, player turns, and UI updates.\n\nMinor areas for improvement include slightly inconsistent commenting across all scripts (though complex sections are well-commented), the presence of placeholder `Debug.Log` statements, an incomplete `MusicVolume` script, and the use of `FindObjectOfType` in a few instances where direct access to a singleton instance (e.g., `GolfGameManager.Instance`) would be more efficient and robust. The purpose of the `ButtonClick` singleton is also not immediately clear from the provided code, potentially making it redundant."

      "comment": "The project documentation provides an exceptionally comprehensive and well-structured overview. The report clearly defines project objectives, detailing the problem statement and the specific goal of 'Pocket Golf AR'. The design process is thoroughly documented, covering game design principles, core gameplay mechanics, detailed AR integration strategies (plane detection, object placement, persistent anchors), and comprehensive UI/UX design with accompanying wireframes and flow diagrams. The development methodology is clearly explained, outlining tools and technologies (Unity, AR Foundation, C#), an iterative development process, and a detailed discussion of key development challenges with their corresponding solutions. Implementation details for core functionalities like `GolfGameManager` and `PathVisualizer` are well-articulated, aligning perfectly with the observations in the coding quality assessment. This submission demonstrates a high level of thought and planning throughout the project lifecycle, showcasing excellent adherence to best practices in project documentation."

      "comment": "The 'Self-Reflection' section (Page 17) provides clear and detailed evidence of individual contributions and learning. The student articulates specific challenges faced, such as mastering AR Foundation intricacies, environment mapping, and performance optimization, and describes the problem-solving approaches taken. The reflection demonstrates a strong understanding of the project's technical and developmental aspects, highlighting significant personal growth in XR development skills. It's a comprehensive and insightful reflection on the learning journey and project management, which is a hallmark of excellent individual contribution documentation."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 7.0,
      "comment": "The submission includes a dedicated 'Performance Analysis' section which serves as strong evidence of testing and validation, particularly concerning technical performance. It provides quantitative metrics (FPS, Draw Calls, Batches, Triangles, Vertices) measured on a specific device (Pixel 6 Pro) and discusses aspects like tracking stability, rendering efficiency, and system resource usage. The report also mentions optimization efforts like batching, light baking, and occlusion culling, indicating a proactive approach to performance. While the performance analysis is thorough, the documentation lacks a comprehensive testing plan, detailed systematic validation steps beyond performance metrics, or explicit user testing results with feedback analysis. This limits it from achieving an 'Excellent' rating, but it provides good evidence of a focused validation approach for technical performance."

It is a well-organized and comprehensive register, clearly documenting each asset's name, type, source/creator, license/usage rights, and any relevant notes. The inclusion of license information is particularly important for professional development and intellectual property considerations. This structured approach ensures proper tracking and legal compliance for all project assets, reflecting a high standard of asset organization and documentation."
