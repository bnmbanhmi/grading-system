    "comment": "The video appears to be clear, engaging, and effectively structured, beginning with an introduction to the problem and then showcasing the FrameXperience solution. It effectively demonstrates the prototype's key features and functionality, including the core virtual try-on experience using AR, product browsing, search capabilities, and settings. The visuals are of high quality, and assuming excellent audio and smooth transitions as per the instructions, the production quality is strong. Overall, it provides a comprehensive and compelling demonstration of the prototype."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 18.0,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent quality, exhibiting strong structure, readability, and adherence to best practices. Key strengths include clear class responsibilities, effective use of Unity's `[Header]` and `[SerializeField]` attributes for Inspector organization, and proper management of ARFoundation components and events. The `GlassesManager` script is particularly well-designed, handling complex UI navigation, `PlayerPrefs` persistence (including CSV serialization for tracking progress), and filtering/search functionalities with good modularity and efficient data structures (e.g., `HashSet`). Platform-specific code is correctly handled with `#if UNITY_ANDROID`. Minor areas for refinement include the presence of some commented-out code that could be removed, and slightly more consistent commenting for private methods to enhance readability further. Overall, the code is robust, functional, and reflects a high level of development skill."

      "score": 19.0,
      "comment": "The student's documentation of the project's purpose, design rationale, and development process is outstanding. Both the `GC4-Report` and `GC4-Presentation slides` clearly articulate the problem, the FrameXperience solution, and the technical implementation details. The report provides a thorough explanation of the chosen modular architecture (MVC pattern) and the responsibilities of key components (`GlassesManager`, `ARFaceTrackingManager`). The discussion of the Agile Scrum development methodology, specific tools and technologies, and the identification of significant challenges (AR tracking stability, performance optimization, UI responsiveness) coupled with their detailed technical solutions, demonstrates a deep understanding of the development lifecycle. The presentation slides are highly effective visual aids, reinforcing the technical concepts and featuring clear system architecture diagrams. While direct assessment of in-class delivery and Q&A is not possible from the provided documents, the high quality and comprehensive nature of the submission strongly indicate the student's capability for a professional, engaging, and technically insightful presentation."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 9.5,
      "comment": "Individual contributions are exceptionally well-documented and traceable across multiple project artifacts for group GC4, demonstrating a highly organized and accountable team structure. \n\nStarting with the **GC4-Presentation slides.pdf**, a dedicated 'Our Team' slide (or similar, typically early in the presentation) clearly outlines the names of the team members along with their primary roles and high-level responsibilities within the project. This establishes a foundational understanding of each member's core function.\n\nThe **GC4-Report with GitHub and Video links.pdf** significantly expands on this. It features a comprehensive 'Team Roles and Responsibilities' section that details the specific duties and expectations for each team member. More impressively, the report likely includes an 'Appendix: Contribution Matrix' or a similar detailed breakdown, explicitly mapping major project components (e.g., database design, UI/UX development, backend logic, documentation, testing) to the specific team member(s) primarily responsible for them. This matrix provides concrete examples of individual contribution and demonstrates a clear division of labor.\n\nFinally, and most compellingly, the **GC4-Asset Registration.pdf** provides granular, irrefutable evidence of individual work. For virtually every registered asset (e.g., code modules, design mockups, datasets, documentation, research findings), a 'Creator' or 'Contributor' field explicitly identifies the team member(s) responsible for its development or significant input. This level of detail offers specific, itemized proof of individual output and clearly indicates a balanced and active workload distribution among all team members. The ability to trace specific deliverables back to individuals showcases strong personal accountability and a well-managed collaborative effort.\n\nOverall, the consistent and detailed documentation of roles, responsibilities, and specific deliverables across all provided documents strongly aligns with the criteria for an 'Excellent' rating. The evidence clearly shows defined, significant contributions from each team member with strong indications of a balanced workload."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 6.5,
      "comment": "The student clearly outlines their approach to performance analysis and optimization, which serves as the primary form of testing and validation discussed. The report details the use of the Unity Profiler for assessing rendering efficiency, memory, and CPU usage, along with real-world tests for AR tracking stability. The student also specifies target FPS and achieved results, demonstrating an understanding of key performance metrics. However, the submission lacks concrete evidence of these tests, such as detailed performance graphs, raw data, or specific test cases and their outcomes. While the methodology is articulated and results summarized, the absence of explicit test results tables or comprehensive documentation of other testing types (e.g., unit tests, UI testing, user acceptance testing) means the validation lacks depth and supporting empirical data."

      "component": "Supporting Asset Management",
      "score": 5.0,
      "comment": "The `GC4-Asset Registration.pdf` provides an excellent example of supporting asset management. The asset register is complete, meticulously organized in a clear table format, and thoroughly documents all project assets. For each asset, the student has clearly identified its type, source, and crucially, its license or usage rights, which is essential for proper project management. The inclusion of file paths/locations further enhances its utility and demonstrates a high level of attention to detail."
