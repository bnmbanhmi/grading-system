    "comment": "The video effectively introduces the problem before clearly demonstrating the core features of FrameXperience, including the virtual try-on using AR, browsing, search functionality, and settings. The app's UI is clean and well-presented. While there was some harsh lighting in the live AR demonstration shots, the functionality was still clearly visible. Assuming smooth transitions, a professional voice-over, and appropriate sound design, the video exhibits high production quality and is very engaging, successfully showcasing the prototype."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 14.5,
    "comment": "The coding quality is very good. The code is generally well-structured, readable, and demonstrates good adherence to Unity and C# best practices, such as proper use of `[Header]`, `[SerializeField]`, `PlayerPrefs.Save()`, event subscription/unsubscription, and platform-specific compilation. Individual scripts are clean and focused. The overall architecture implies a well-organized project (e.g., `Resources/Glasses`).\n\nThe primary area for improvement is the `GlassesManager` script, which takes on a very broad range of responsibilities (AR management, UI panel switching, stats tracking, voucher logic, filtering, search). While functional, this monolithic approach slightly impacts modularity and maintainability. Breaking down some of its responsibilities into smaller, more focused classes (e.g., a `UIManager`, `VoucherSystem`, or `StatsTracker`) would further enhance the project's structure and scalability. There are also minor instances of commented-out code that could be removed for cleaner submission.\n\nDespite these minor points, the code is robust, functional, and of high quality, placing it firmly in the 'Good' to 'Excellent' range."

      "component": "Project Description, Design & Development Process",
      "score": 19.0,
      "comment": "The report provides an exceptionally comprehensive and clear overview of the project. The problem statement, objectives, and proposed solution are well-articulated. The design process is thoroughly documented, including detailed user personas, user stories, feature lists, a clear system architecture, and well-designed UI/UX wireframes and mockups. The development methodology (Agile/Scrum-like) is clearly explained, along with the specific tools, technologies, and core development stages. The challenges faced during development and their respective solutions are well-documented, demonstrating a deep understanding of the technical hurdles. This section showcases an excellent grasp of project management and design principles, aligning with the high quality observed in the final product."

      "score": 10.0,
      "comment": "The report clearly establishes the student's role as the sole developer, comprehensively detailing all aspects of the project they were responsible for, from initial design and AR integration to scripting, UI/UX, 3D asset creation, testing, and documentation. The 'Learning and Reflection' section is particularly strong, offering insightful commentary on the technical challenges encountered (e.g., AR integration, performance optimization, precise face tracking) and the specific skills acquired throughout the development process. This demonstrates clear individual involvement, significant learning, and a reflective approach to the project."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 9.5,
      "comment": "The testing and validation process is thoroughly documented and highly comprehensive. The report outlines a clear testing strategy covering Unit, Integration, System, Performance, and User Acceptance testing. Specific performance metrics (FPS, CPU, GPU, memory usage) are provided, demonstrating a systematic analysis of the application's efficiency. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) was conducted with 10 participants, yielding both quantitative (average rating 4.2/5) and qualitative feedback, which is clearly summarized. The student not only describes the testing but also presents the results effectively, indicating a robust approach to ensuring quality and addressing issues identified during the process."

      "component": "Supporting Asset Management",
      "score": 5.0,
      "comment": "The supporting asset management is excellently documented. The 'GC4-Asset Registration.pdf' provides a comprehensive list of all assets used, including 3D models, UI elements, sounds, and fonts, along with their respective sources (self-created, purchased, or external libraries). The document also explicitly states the intended organization structure within the Unity project (e.g., 'Models', 'Sprites', 'Sounds'), which implies a well-thought-out and proper file structure. This demonstrates a high level of organization and attention to detail regarding project assets."
