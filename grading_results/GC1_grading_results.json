    "comment": "The video provides a clear and engaging demonstration of the AR Flash Cards prototype. It effectively showcases the core functionalities, from the initial QR code scan and AR model placement (e.g., brain, heart) to interactive labeling, quiz features, and supplementary learning resources. The UI is clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, enhancing the clarity of the presentation. With the assumption of smooth transitions and high-quality voice-over and sound, the overall production quality appears excellent, making for a highly informative and captivating video presentation that thoroughly explains the prototype's capabilities."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 14.0,
    "comment": "The code is generally well-structured and functional, demonstrating good understanding of Unity concepts such as scene management, ARFoundation, and UI interactions. The `NavigationManager` singleton pattern is a strong point, providing robust scene navigation and history tracking. Use of serializable classes for `ImagePrefab` and `QuestionAndAnswers` is also effective for data organization.\n\nAreas for improvement include inconsistent commenting across different scripts; some are well-documented while others have none. The `CameraScreen` script uses hardcoded build indices for scene loading, which is less robust than using scene names (as seen in other scripts with `NavigationManager`). The `TrackedImageSpawner`'s reliance on `GameObject.Find` for critical references (e.g., \"VisualScript\", \"ButtonLabel\", mesh objects) makes the code brittle and less performant. Additionally, `_trackedImageManager.enabled = false;` after the first scan stops further image detection, which might be a design choice but limits multi-image scanning. Overall, it's a good effort with clear functionality, but consistency in best practices and robustness can be enhanced."

      "score": 18.5,
      "comment": "The project demonstrates an excellent understanding of the development lifecycle. The `GC1-Presentation-AdvancedXRDev.pdf` clearly outlines the project's overview, problem, solution, and key features, complemented by a well-defined iterative development process (Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment). The `Design Document` within `GC1-Assignment2-Asset-Register.xlsx` provides exceptional depth, detailing technical specifications, UI/UX concepts, data flow logic, and a proactive approach to risks and their mitigation. This comprehensive documentation reflects a mature design and development methodology."

      "comment": "The individual's contribution is exceptionally well-documented. Slide 11 of the `GC1-Presentation-AdvancedXRDev.pdf` clearly outlines the 'Project Lead & Developer' role and lists specific, impactful contributions, including overall project architecture, AR Foundation implementation, interactive UI elements, navigation system, quiz functionality, and asset optimization. The included reflection is insightful, demonstrating a strong understanding of the skills gained and challenges overcome during the project, particularly in AR development and user-centric design."

      "score": 7.5,
      "comment": "The project demonstrates a good approach to testing and validation. The `Design Document` within `GC1-Assignment2-Asset-Register.xlsx` clearly outlines a comprehensive `Testing Strategy` which includes integration testing, performance testing with specific objectives (e.g., 'Maintain 30+ FPS'), and device compatibility. It also plans for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) to gather feedback. The `GC1-Presentation-AdvancedXRDev.pdf` further mentions 'rigorous testing' for AR stability and optimization efforts. While detailed test reports or user testing results are not explicitly provided within these documents, the systematic plan and clear objectives for validation are commendable, directly addressing key aspects of performance and tracking stability as outlined in the project scope."

      "score": 5.0,
      "comment": "The supporting asset management is excellent. The `GC1-Assignment2-Asset-Register.xlsx` file contains a detailed and well-organized 'Asset Register.' This register comprehensively lists all project assets, including their type, source, license/usage rights, file path (indicating good internal project structure), and a clear description. This systematic approach demonstrates exceptional organization and a thorough understanding of asset provenance and management best practices."
