    "comment": "The video effectively showcases the DineAR prototype, demonstrating both the engaging augmented reality (AR) user experience and the comprehensive backend menu management system. The visuals are clear, presenting the AR models and app interface distinctly. Key features like viewing detailed nutritional information, switching between food items, and the ability to add new dishes through the admin dashboard are clearly demonstrated. Assuming high-quality audio and smooth transitions as per the instructions, the production quality appears excellent, making for a very clear and engaging presentation of the prototype's functionality."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 18.5,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent quality, readability, and structure. Each script is modular, well-commented, and follows Unity best practices, such as proper use of `[SerializeField]`, event handling, and null checks for robustness. The implementation of UI logic (screen management, modal interactions, dynamic button population) and AR features (marker detection, model spawning) is clear and efficient. No major bugs are apparent from the provided code snippets."

      "score": 19.0,
      "comment": "The project description is highly comprehensive, clearly outlining objectives, key features, and user flow. The design documentation is excellent, detailing the architecture and technology stack. The development process, articulated through an Agile sprint methodology, is well-explained. The challenges and solutions, along with future enhancements, further demonstrate a thorough approach."

      "score": 7.0,
      "comment": "As an individual submission, the high quality and comprehensive nature of the entire project (demonstrated across the video, coding, design, and testing documentation) provides strong implicit evidence of the student's significant contribution. However, the submission lacks explicit documentation of personal reflection on learning or a specific breakdown of roles and responsibilities, which would elevate it to an 'Excellent' level for this specific criterion."

    {
      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 9.0,
      "comment": "The submission includes comprehensive user acceptance test feedback forms from multiple testers, clearly documenting usability, AR functionality, and performance observations. This provides strong evidence of systematic validation. While a formal, standalone testing plan or detailed performance analysis report was not provided, the user feedback forms effectively demonstrate a robust validation process and identify minor areas for improvement, aligning very well with 'Excellent' criteria."

      "score": 5.0,
      "comment": "The `GC2-Asset Register.xlsx` is exceptionally well-organized and comprehensive. It clearly documents all project assets, including 3D models, UI elements, audio, and marker images, specifying their category, type, source, licensing, description, and file path. This level of detail and organization perfectly meets the 'Excellent' criteria for asset management."
