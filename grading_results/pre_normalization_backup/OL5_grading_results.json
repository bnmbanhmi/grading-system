    "comment": "The video presentation appears highly clear and engaging. The visual quality is excellent, with sharp text on title slides and well-rendered AR objects integrated into the real environment. Key features like 'Add & Place Items' and 'Change Item Color' are effectively showcased through the demonstration of adding various furniture items and altering their colors. The structured presentation with clear title slides and feature highlights enhances understanding. Assuming smooth transitions as instructed, along with a high-quality voice-over and sound, the overall production quality seems to be very high, contributing to an effective and professional demonstration of the AR Room Customizer prototype."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 14.5,
    "comment": "The code is generally well-structured, highly readable, and exceptionally well-documented with extensive XML comments and `[Tooltip]` attributes, indicating strong adherence to best practices. Modularity is good, and the use of Unity-specific features (Editor scripting, UI events, XR interactions) is appropriate and effectively implemented across all three scripts.\n\nHowever, there is a notable functional bug in `ObjectSpawner.cs` where the `TrySpawnObject` method contradicts the documented behavior of `spawnOptionIndex` and `isSpawnOptionRandomized`. If `spawnOptionIndex` is set to -1 (which, according to documentation, should trigger random spawning), `TrySpawnObject` currently returns `false` instead of selecting a random prefab, preventing this stated functionality from working. The `ARTemplateMenuManager` script further contributes to this by setting `spawnOptionIndex` to -1 after each object selection, thus ensuring the bug's effect. Minor typos like 'Verticale' in `ObjectSpawner.cs` and 'mateialList' in `ARTemplateMenuManager.cs` are also present. The `Update` method in `ARTemplateMenuManager.cs` also has some slight redundancy in its pointer-over-UI checks.\n\nDespite these issues, the overall quality of the code is very high, demonstrating strong foundational coding practices and good implementation of Unity-specific patterns, placing it firmly in the 'Good' category, very close to 'Excellent' if the functional bug and minor issues were addressed."

      "score": 18.0,
      "comment": "The presentation clearly articulates the project's purpose, problem statement, solution, target audience, and scope, aligning perfectly with the project objectives. The design rationale is well-explained through the 'User Interface Design' and 'Key Features' sections, emphasizing user-friendliness. The development process is detailed, outlining an Agile methodology with specific phases and effectively addressing technical challenges such as AR tracking stability and performance optimization with practical solutions. The structured nature of the presentation, combined with the assumed excellent delivery and visual aids (as indicated by the previous video presentation assessment), ensures high clarity and engagement, demonstrating strong technical detail."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 8.0,
      "comment": "The team has effectively documented individual contributions, meeting the criteria for an excellent assessment. The `OL5-OL-5 - ARRoomCustomizer Presentation.pdf` clearly introduces each team member and their designated role on Slide 2, titled 'Meet the Team'. It specifies roles such as Project Manager, Developer, UI/UX Designer, and Quality Assurance, providing a strong foundation for understanding team structure and individual responsibilities.\n\nCrucially, the `OL5-OL-5 - Asset Register.xlsx` provides robust and specific evidence of individual contributions and workload distribution. The 'Responsible Person' column within this document explicitly links various project assets (e.g., UI/UX Mockups, Database Schema, AR Models, Testing Reports, Presentation Slides, Documentation) to individual team members. This demonstrates a clear division of labor and accountability for tangible project outputs. The presence of specific assets assigned to each team member indicates that all members had significant, identifiable contributions to the project's deliverables.\n\nWhile the submitted documents do not include individual reflection statements or granular task breakdowns beyond asset ownership, the combination of clear role definition and detailed assignment of responsibilities for specific project assets demonstrates a well-managed approach to individual contributions and workload distribution. This evidence is strong enough to place the team in the excellent category."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 6.5,
      "comment": "The presentation clearly outlines a structured testing methodology, encompassing Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and User Acceptance Testing, along with relevant key test cases (e.g., object placement, color change, UI responsiveness, performance). This demonstrates a sound and comprehensive approach to testing. However, while the presentation articulates the successful outcomes of validation (e.g., 'Prototype successfully demonstrates core functionality,' 'stable tracking'), it lacks specific, detailed evidence of these validation results. Concrete metrics, explicit test logs, or visual proof of successful tests are not explicitly provided in the documentation, which limits the depth of validation shown beyond summary statements."

      "score": 5.0,
      "comment": "The provided `Asset Register.xlsx` is exceptionally complete, well-organised, and thoroughly documented. It meticulously lists all critical assets used in the project, including 3D models, Unity libraries, scripting language, UI components (fonts, icons), materials, and audio files. For each asset, comprehensive details such as its type, source/license, detailed description, specific usage in the project, and relevant notes are provided. This exemplary documentation demonstrates a strong commitment to professional asset management and clearly meets the 'Excellent' criteria."
