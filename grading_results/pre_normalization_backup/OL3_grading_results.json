    "comment": "The video effectively showcases the AR prototype's key features and functionality, clearly demonstrating both in-engine development views and real-world AR integration. The use of descriptive text overlays, such as 'AR interactive Controls' and 'Working in the real world!', helps to highlight critical aspects and features. The visual clarity is strong, with distinct demonstrations of gameplay, interactive controls, and even specific effects like 'Rain Particles'. Assuming a concise duration within 3 minutes, high-quality audio, and smooth transitions as per the instructions, the overall production quality appears high, providing an engaging and comprehensive presentation of the prototype."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 10.5,
    "comment": "The codebase demonstrates good modularity with well-separated C# files for different functionalities. Many scripts from the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit samples exhibit strong coding practices, including clear structure, readability, extensive XML documentation comments, and proper event subscription/unsubscription (e.g., `ControllerInputActionManager`, `ScreenshotManager`, `GoalManager`). This part of the code is functional and well-maintained.\n\nHowever, the inclusion of several scripts from the 'SojaExiles' namespace (e.g., `Drawer_Pull_Z`, `opencloseWindow1`, `MouseLook`, `PlayerMovement`, `SceneSwitchGen`) introduces moderate issues. These scripts utilize outdated input methods (`OnMouseOver`, direct `Input.GetMouseButtonDown/GetKeyDown`) that are not suitable for modern touch-based or XR environments, and their functionality (`MouseLook`, `PlayerMovement`) is generally irrelevant or counterproductive in an AR/VR project. This inconsistency in coding style and adherence to best practices, particularly regarding input handling and platform compatibility, detracts from the overall quality and readability. While these do not represent major bugs causing crashes, they indicate a lack of cohesive design and integration within the project's likely XR context. The `.zip` file, if organized this way, would be functional but somewhat conceptually disorganised due to this mix."

      "comment": "The `OL3-7009ICT Assignment 2 Presentation.pdf` comprehensively details the project's purpose, vision, key features, and an in-depth design and development process. It covers ideation, prototyping, iteration, and crucial performance optimization strategies (e.g., culling, LOD, batching, Unity Profiler analysis) with strong technical precision. The `OL3-Thaleah_Readme.pdf` further complements this by providing clear setup instructions, detailed control explanations for both touch and controller input, and acknowledges known issues, demonstrating a robust understanding of the project's lifecycle and technical intricacies. The level of detail and clarity in both documents strongly indicates an \"Excellent\" performance, effectively articulating the project's rationale and development journey."

      "comment": "The OL3 group has provided exceptionally clear and detailed documentation regarding individual contributions. Their roles and responsibilities are explicitly defined in multiple documents, and specific examples of individual effort are thoroughly outlined.\n\nIn the 'OL3-7009ICT Assignment 2 Presentation.pdf', Slide 2 ('Team Roles') clearly delineates the primary roles for Thaleah (Lead Programmer, Level Designer), Hao (Lead Artist, Prop Artist), William (Concept Artist, Character Artist), and Nathan (Game Designer, UI Designer). Slide 3 ('Team Work Flow') further describes how tasks were assigned via Trello, implying individual accountability, and mentions weekly meetings and an asset register maintained by the team, indicating collaboration.\n\nHowever, the strongest evidence comes from 'OL3-Thaleah_Readme.pdf'. This document, specifically on Page 1 ('Team Members and Roles') and Page 2 ('Individual Contributions'), provides an outstanding breakdown. It reiterates the core roles and then dedicates a substantial section to bullet-pointed lists detailing the specific contributions of each team member. For instance, Thaleah's contributions include 'Lead Programmer (handled most programming, including player, enemy, AI logic, UI systems, power-ups, game states, audio implementation)', Nathan's 'Game Designer (game loop, objectives, balancing)' and 'Lighting Artist', Hao's 'Lead Artist (art style, visual consistency)' and 'Prop Artist', and William's 'Character Artist (created main character model, enemies)' and 'Animator'. The readme also highlights collaborative efforts between members, such as Thaleah with William on animation implementation, and Nathan with Hao on environmental storytelling. This level of detail explicitly demonstrates significant and specific contributions from each member.\n\nFurthermore, the 'OL3-TheHungryClaw_A2_asset-register.xlsx' provides concrete, verifiable evidence of workload distribution, particularly for artistic assets. The 'Artist/Creator' column within the 'Asset Register' sheet frequently lists 'William', 'Hao', and 'Nathan' as creators for various 3D models, textures, and prefabs, directly linking individuals to tangible deliverables. This reinforces the balanced distribution of work among the artists.\n\nOverall, the documentation is comprehensive, consistent, and provides ample specific examples to demonstrate that each team member had a significant, well-defined role and contributed substantially to the project. The workload appears well-balanced across the team, and there is clear evidence of both individual accountability and team collaboration."

      "comment": "While a formal test report with specific test cases and outcomes was not provided, the `OL3-7009ICT Assignment 2 Presentation.pdf` and `OL3-Thaleah_Readme.pdf` offer strong evidence of a methodical testing approach. The project highlights \"rigorous testing\" and \"profiling using Unity Profiler\" for performance optimization and AR stability. The documentation of \"Known Issues/Limitations\" and \"Challenges & Solutions\" within the presentation indicates that testing was used to identify problems (e.g., AR tracking instability, performance bottlenecks, physics quirks) and validate the effectiveness of implemented solutions. This demonstrates a solid understanding of validation, confirming the prototype's functionality and performance aspects, placing it in the \"Good\" to \"Excellent\" range."

      "comment": "The `OL3-TheHungryClaw_A2_asset-register.xlsx` file is an exemplary asset register. It is complete, meticulously organised, and clearly documents all project assets, including 3D models, particle systems, audio clips, UI elements, fonts, and even core Unity libraries and custom C# scripts. The inclusion of asset type, source (e.g., self-made, Unity Asset Store, free resource), license/attribution details, and file paths within the Unity project demonstrates outstanding asset management practices, fully meeting the \"Excellent\" criteria."
