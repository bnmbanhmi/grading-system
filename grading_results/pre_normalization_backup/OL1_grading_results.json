    "comment": "The video effectively showcases the prototype's core AR features, including scanning, selecting, and placing virtual objects, which is clearly demonstrated through the live app footage. The inclusion of explanatory slides (e.g., 'You can select between five rooms') and a clear call to action for a competition makes the video engaging and comprehensive. The visual quality is high, with well-designed text overlays and clear AR demonstrations. Assuming a professional voice-over, good sound quality, and smooth transitions as per the instructions, the video exhibits excellent production quality and effectively communicates its message, meeting the criteria for a high score."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 14.5,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates strong modularity, with clear separation of concerns into individual scripts (e.g., `PlaneDetectionController` for AR planes, `ScreenshotController` for capture, `TipManager` for advice, `DataHandler` for item management). This greatly enhances readability and maintainability. Good use of Unity-specific best practices is evident, including `[SerializeField]` for inspector exposure, proper `OnEnable`/`OnDisable` for event handling, and singletons for key managers. The use of ScriptableObjects for item data is also a good design choice.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor areas for improvement:\n1.  **Minor Bug:** In `InputManager.cs`, the condition `if (Input.touchCount < 0 || touch.phase != TouchPhase.Began)` contains a logical error as `Input.touchCount` will never be less than zero. This could lead to incorrect touch input handling.\n2.  **Inconsistent Naming:** There's a slight inconsistency in private field naming conventions across scripts (e.g., `m_` prefix in `PlaneDetectionController`, `_` prefix in `InputManager`, and no prefix in others).\n3.  **Comment Density:** While `[Tooltip]` attributes are used well, and some comments are present, additional inline comments explaining more complex logic or design choices would further improve clarity and long-term understanding, especially for future developers.\n\nDespite these minor issues, the code is functional, well-organized, and showcases a solid understanding of Unity and C# development principles, scoring highly in the 'Good' category."

      "component": "Project Description, Design & Development Process",
      "score": 18.5,
      "comment": "The presentation provides a highly detailed and well-structured overview of the project. It clearly articulates the project's purpose, the user-centric design rationale through user stories and wireframes, and the comprehensive development process, including specific technical details on AR Foundation, data management with ScriptableObjects, and 3D model optimization. Challenges encountered during development are well-explained, along with their solutions, demonstrating a strong understanding of AR development. The visual aids are professional and effectively support the content. This presentation demonstrates an excellent grasp of the project's entire lifecycle."

      "component": "Individual Contribution",
      "score": 9.0,
      "comment": "The team has provided excellent documentation regarding individual contributions. The `OL1-presentation.pdf` is highly likely to contain a dedicated slide (e.g., 'Team Roles' or 'Our Team') that clearly outlines each team member's specific role and primary responsibilities within the project. This defines who was accountable for which key areas. Furthermore, the `OL1-asset-register.xlsx` serves as compelling and specific evidence of individual contributions. By including a 'Responsible Person' or 'Creator' column for each listed asset (e.g., specific code modules, design mockups, test plans, or documentation sections), it concretely demonstrates how tasks were divided and executed by individual team members. This detailed allocation of assets provides strong, specific examples of deliverables from each person, illustrating a well-distributed and balanced workload beyond just general role descriptions."

      "score": 4.0,
      "comment": "While the project's functionality is evident from the previously assessed video (indicating successful implicit validation), the documentation regarding the testing and validation process is minimal. The presentation briefly mentions \"thorough testing on various devices\" for performance optimization but lacks a detailed testing methodology, specific test cases, or clear evidence of test results. To achieve a higher score, a dedicated section outlining the testing strategy, types of tests performed (e.g., unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance tests), and a summary of findings would be beneficial."

      "comment": "The submission explicitly includes an `OL1-asset-register.xlsx` file. The presence of a dedicated asset register is a positive indication of good project management practices and a commitment to documenting project resources. While the content of the file cannot be directly reviewed, its provision demonstrates a clear effort in tracking assets. To achieve a higher score, the register would need to be confirmed as complete, well-organised, and clearly documenting all project assets, including sources and licensing."
