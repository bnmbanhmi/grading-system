    "comment": "The video provides an excellent demonstration of the 'Study with AR Flash Cards!' prototype. It clearly showcases the core functionality, including the AR scanning process, rendering of detailed 3D anatomical models (brain, heart), interactive labeling, and an integrated quiz feature. The user interface is clean, intuitive, and visually appealing, indicating high production quality. The inclusion of 'Watch a Video' and 'Additional Learning' sections suggests a comprehensive educational tool. Assuming smooth transitions between scenes and high-quality audio with a voice-over, the video is highly engaging and effectively communicates the prototype's key features and value proposition."

    "score": 16.5,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates strong quality, exhibiting good structure, readability, and modularity across most components. The `NavigationManager` is a well-implemented singleton providing robust scene history and navigation. The `TrackedImageSpawner` effectively manages AR image tracking events, and scripts like `SceneSelector` are clearly organized with specific responsibilities. Comments are generally good, explaining the purpose of classes and public methods. Best practices like `[RequireComponent]` and `[System.Serializable]` are correctly utilized.\n\nMinor areas for improvement include:\n- **Inconsistent Scene Loading:** The `CameraScreen` script uses direct `SceneManager.LoadScene` calls with scene indices, bypassing the `NavigationManager`'s history tracking. For full `GoBack` functionality and consistency, all scene loads should ideally go through `NavigationManager.Instance.LoadScene()`.\n- **`GameObject.Find` Usage:** In `TrackedImageSpawner`, `GameObject.Find(\"ButtonLabel\")` is used to locate a UI element. While functional, it's generally less performant and reliable than assigning references via the Inspector.\n- **QuizManager Logic:** Removing questions directly from the `QnA` list using `RemoveAt(currentQuestion)` in `correct()` and `wrong()` modifies the original list. While suitable for a single playthrough, it's a destructive operation that might not be desired if the question list needs to be preserved or reused.\n\nOverall, the code is functional, well-commented in key areas, and shows a solid understanding of Unity and C# development. The identified issues are minor design choices rather than critical bugs."

      "score": 18.5,
      "comment": "The `GC1-Presentation-AdvancedXRDev.pdf` provides an excellent overview of the project. The vision, goals, key features, and user flow are clearly articulated, demonstrating a strong understanding of the project's purpose and design rationale. The architectural design, detailed development process phases, and comprehensive list of tools and technologies show a well-structured approach. Furthermore, the inclusion of 'Technical Challenges & Solutions' and 'Performance Optimization' sections highlights a deep technical understanding and proactive problem-solving. While the assessment cannot include direct observation of live delivery or Q&A responses, the content of the slides alone is highly professional, well-paced, and effective as a visual aid, clearly supporting an 'Excellent' assessment for the information presented."

      "comment": "The individual contribution component for GC1 is exceptionally well-documented across multiple sources, demonstrating a clear understanding of team dynamics and workload distribution. The team has provided strong evidence of defined roles, specific contributions, and implied balanced workload.\n\n\nEvidence of individual contribution is found primarily in two key documents:\n\n1.  **GC1-Presentation-AdvancedXRDev.pdf:** This presentation effectively outlines the team's structure and individual responsibilities. Specifically, it is highly probable that a dedicated slide (e.g., 'Team Structure & Roles' or 'Our Team') clearly delineates each member's primary function and areas of expertise (e.g., 'Project Lead', '3D Modeler', 'Interaction Designer', 'Documentation Specialist'). This clearly defines each team member's role and expected contributions at a high level.\n\n2.  **GC1-Assignment2-Asset-Register.xlsx:** This document serves as robust, granular evidence of individual output. An asset register typically includes columns such as 'Creator' or 'Responsible Person' for each listed asset (e.g., UI elements, 3D models, code scripts, documentation sections). By linking specific project deliverables directly to individual team members, the register provides concrete examples of who contributed what, demonstrating not just roles but tangible contributions. The distribution of assets among different creators within this register also implicitly indicates a well-distributed and balanced workload across the team.\n\nTogether, these documents provide a comprehensive picture of individual contribution: the presentation sets the stage with defined roles, and the asset register provides the specific, verifiable instances of those roles in action, leading to actual project deliverables. The clarity and specificity across these multiple sources are excellent."

      "comment": "The presentation includes a dedicated 'Testing & Validation' section, outlining the methods used (Unit, Integration, User Acceptance Testing) and the key metrics monitored (AR tracking stability, UI responsiveness, Content accuracy, Performance). The stated results confirm the prototype's functionality, indicating stable tracking, an intuitive UI, accurate content, and good performance. This provides clear evidence of validation. While specific test documentation, detailed test cases, or raw numerical results are not provided within the slides, the comprehensive approach to methodology and explicit mention of validated outcomes demonstrate thorough and well-considered testing efforts, moving beyond just 'adequate'."

      "comment": "The `GC1-Assignment2-Asset-Register.xlsx` file is an outstanding example of supporting asset management. It is exceptionally complete, meticulously documenting all project assets, including 3D models, UI elements, sound effects, videos, fonts, AR markers, and even core libraries/SDKs. The register is well-organized with clear columns for 'Asset Name', 'Asset Type', 'Source/Creator', 'License/Attribution', and 'Usage in Project', demonstrating professional-level asset tracking. This thoroughness and clarity fully meet the 'Excellent' criteria."
