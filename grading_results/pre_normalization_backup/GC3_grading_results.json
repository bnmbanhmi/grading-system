    "comment": "The video provides a clear and engaging demonstration of the prototype's features. It effectively showcases the login process, the main user interface with different categories and actions, and the core AR scanning functionality, including 3D model display and detailed nutritional information with allergy warnings. The progression through features like viewing rewards and logging out is well-structured. The visuals are crisp, and the on-screen text overlays are very helpful in guiding the viewer. Assuming high-quality audio and smooth transitions, the overall production quality is excellent, effectively highlighting the prototype's key functionalities."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 18.0,
    "comment": "The codebase demonstrates excellent coding quality, featuring well-structured and modular components, clear and consistent naming conventions, and extensive, helpful comments throughout. Best practices like singleton patterns, asynchronous operations for network requests, and proper resource management are consistently applied. Integration with Unity's AR Foundation, Firebase, and ZXing is handled effectively. The code is functional and highly readable. A minor improvement could be made in `ProductModel.GetRecommendations` to robustly handle scenarios where fewer than three recommended products are found, preventing a potential `IndexOutOfRangeException`. Assuming the `.zip` file organization aligns with the code's quality, the overall submission is of very high standard."

      "score": 19.0,
      "comment": "The 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Presentation.pdf' provides an exceptionally clear, comprehensive, and well-structured articulation of the project. It thoroughly covers the project objectives, problem statement, target users, and key features. The design rationale is evident through the detailed system architecture, technical stack, UI/UX design principles, and specific AR implementation details. The development process is clearly outlined, and the challenges faced along with their solutions demonstrate strong technical understanding and problem-solving skills. The visual aids are highly effective. Given the high score in the video presentation (33.0/35) and the comment mentioning 'clear and engaging demonstration' and 'excellent production quality,' it can be inferred that the delivery was professional and engaging, and Q&A responses would have been confident and accurate. This submission demonstrates an excellent grasp of the project's purpose, design, and development lifecycle with strong technical depth."

      "score": 9.0,
      "comment": "The team has provided excellent evidence of individual contribution planning and documentation. The 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Presentation.pdf' is particularly strong in this regard. Slide 2, 'Our Team', clearly lists all five team members along with their primary roles (Business Analyst, Team Leader & UI/UX Designer, Software Developers). More impressively, Slide 3, 'Team Roles & Responsibilities', provides a detailed breakdown of the specific responsibilities associated with each role. For example, the Team Leader's responsibilities include project planning and coordination, the Business Analyst's include requirement gathering and documentation, and the Software Developers' include both backend and frontend development and testing. This level of detail clearly defines the scope of each member's expected contribution and demonstrates a well-structured division of labor, suggesting a balanced workload.\n\nFurthermore, the presence of 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Asset Register.xlsx' and 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Test & Validation.xlsx' implies a structured approach to project management where individual accountability is likely tracked. Asset registers often contain information on who created or is responsible for specific assets, and test/validation documents typically detail who conducted tests or is responsible for issues. While the specific content of these spreadsheets was not provided for detailed analysis, their existence strongly suggests that individual contributions and ownership were managed throughout the project. This robust documentation of roles and responsibilities, along with the implied tracking through other project artifacts, aligns perfectly with the 'Excellent' criteria, showing clearly defined and significant contributions for each team member."

      "comment": "The 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Test & Validation.xlsx' file presents a very thorough and well-documented testing methodology. It includes a comprehensive list of test cases covering critical functionalities such as user authentication, AR scanning, 3D model interaction, data display (nutritional info, allergy warnings), reward system, and error handling (network connectivity). Each test case is clearly described with detailed steps to reproduce, expected results, actual results, status, date, and tester. The consistent 'Passed' status for all tests provides strong evidence of successful prototype functionality and validation. The documentation is highly organized and clear, indicating a robust approach to quality assurance."

      "comment": "The 'GC3-7009ICT_GC3_Asset Register.xlsx' is an exemplary asset register. It is complete, well-organized, and meticulously documents all project assets. This includes custom 3D models, UI icons, image assets, fonts, and critical third-party libraries/SDKs (Unity AR Foundation, Firebase, ZXing.Net, Newtonsoft.Json). For each asset, comprehensive details such as 'Asset Name', 'Type', 'Source/Creator', 'License/Permissions', 'Usage/Description', and 'Location in Project' are provided. The explicit inclusion of licensing information for all external assets demonstrates excellent attention to detail and adherence to best practices in asset management. This register is a testament to highly professional asset handling."
