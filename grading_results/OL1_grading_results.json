    "comment": "The video effectively presents the prototype's core functionality, clearly demonstrating how users can scan areas, select models, and place them using augmented reality. The visuals are crisp, and the inclusion of text overlays like 'SCAN THE AREA' and 'SELECT THE MODEL' enhances clarity and guides the viewer through the process. The video appears engaging and comprehensive in showcasing key features. Assuming high production quality for audio (voice-over and sound) and that the video is within the specified time limit, it achieves a high standard of presentation."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 16.3,
    "comment": "The code demonstrates excellent overall quality, showing strong adherence to best practices in Unity development. \n\n**Positives:**\n- **Well-Structured & Modular:** Code is highly modular with clear separation of concerns across different scripts (e.g., PlaneDetectionController, TipManager, DataHandler, UIManager). Singleton patterns are used effectively where global access is beneficial.\n- **Readability:** Variable naming is consistent and descriptive, and methods are well-defined, making the code easy to understand. Tooltip attributes and comments are used appropriately.\n- **Best Practices:** \n    - Proper use of Unity lifecycle methods (Awake, OnEnable, OnDisable) for event subscription/unsubscription.\n    - Effective use of ScriptableObjects (Item.cs) for data management.\n    - Robust UI interaction handling with `GraphicRaycaster` and `IsPointerOverUI` checks.\n    - Good use of coroutines for async operations (screenshot, tip fading).\n    - Integration with external libraries (`NativeGallery`, `DOTween`) is handled cleanly.\n    - Error handling with `Debug.LogError` and null checks is present.\n\n**Areas for Minor Improvement:**\n- **UIContentFitter.cs:** The manual width calculation (`childCount` logic, missing `padding.right`) is brittle and prone to minor layout inaccuracies. Unity's `ContentSizeFitter` component could be considered, or the manual calculation needs refinement.\n- **InputManager.cs:** The `Input.touchCount < 0` condition is dead code. While the touch phase logic functions, it could be slightly more robustly structured. Additionally, scene loading methods are duplicated across `InputManager.cs` and `ButtonScript.cs`; centralizing these would improve maintainability.\n- **Competition/Voting Features:** The `CompetitionController.cs` hardcodes username and initial votes, and the `VoteController.cs` increments votes without persistence. While functional for a basic demo, for a real 'competition', these aspects would require more robust data handling and storage."

      "score": 18.5,
      "comment": "The project description clearly outlines the objectives, target audience, and core functionality of the AR Home Decor App. The design process is well-documented, featuring a logical architecture diagram, a clear AR workflow, and comprehensive UI/UX design principles supported by flow diagrams, wireframes, and mockups. The development methodology is explicitly defined as Agile, detailing iterative sprints, version control usage (Git), and regular stand-ups. This provides a very thorough and well-structured documentation of the project's foundational elements and execution strategy."

      "comment": "The documentation clearly outlines the various roles and responsibilities undertaken by the student, including project management, core AR development, UI/UX design and implementation, data management, community features, and testing. This demonstrates comprehensive individual involvement across all significant project phases, indicating a broad and deep contribution. While a deeply personal reflection on learning might be beneficial, the breadth of documented responsibilities effectively showcases the student's extensive individual effort."

      "score": 7.5,
      "comment": "The submission provides a systematic testing methodology, explicitly outlining unit, integration, and system testing approaches with clear, relevant test cases. It also effectively addresses performance analysis, detailing monitoring of FPS, memory usage, and tracking stability, which aligns well with the project scope. The validation results confirm acceptable performance and tracking stability. While the results are general and specific user testing feedback is not provided, the overall testing approach is robust and well-documented, demonstrating a solid commitment to quality assurance."
