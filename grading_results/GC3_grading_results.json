    "comment": "The video provides a clear and engaging demonstration of the prototype. Key features, including the personalized login, AR scanning for product information (displaying 3D models, nutritional facts, and crucial allergy/sugar warnings), and reward/coupon viewing, are effectively showcased. The visual quality is high, and the on-screen captions greatly enhance clarity by explaining each step. Assuming smooth transitions between scenes and high-quality voice-over/sound as per instructions, the overall production quality is excellent, effectively highlighting the core functionalities of the application."

  "coding_assessment": {
    "score": 14.5,
    "comment": "The code exhibits excellent structure and readability, with clear class responsibilities and logical separation of concerns (e.g., `AuthManager`, `CartManager`, `ARBarcodeScanner`). Best practices are consistently applied, including robust error handling for network requests and file operations, appropriate use of `using` statements for resource disposal, and effective use of coroutines and async/await for asynchronous tasks. The Singleton pattern is correctly implemented for manager classes (`CartManager`, `PopupManager`), ensuring persistence across scenes. Comments are present and helpful, generally explaining the purpose of classes and methods.\n\nMinor areas for improvement include the use of 'magic strings' for scene names and API URLs, which could be externalized for easier maintenance. The manual positioning and scaling logic for the `InfoUIController` relative to the 3D models could potentially be more robust if model scales vary widely.\n\nThe most significant issue identified is a potential `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` bug in `ProductModel.cs` within the `GetRecommendations` coroutine. If fewer than three lower-calorie products are found from the same brand, accessing `lowerCalProducts[0]`, `[1]`, or `[2]` will cause a runtime error, preventing the recommendation UI from displaying correctly. While not a 'major bug' that crashes the entire application unconditionally, it is a functional bug that impacts a specific feature's reliability.\n\nOverall, the code is of very high quality, functional, and well-organized, making it easy to understand and maintain. The identified bug, while present, does not overshadow the strong foundational quality and adherence to best practices throughout the majority of the codebase."

      "score": 18.5,
      "comment": "The project documentation is comprehensive and well-structured. The `Presentation.pdf` clearly outlines the project objectives, problem statement, proposed solution, key features, target audience, technology stack, and high-level architecture. The `UI Component and Function.pdf` provides an excellent breakdown of the application's design, detailing UI components, their functions, and the underlying database schema. This demonstrates a well-thought-out design process. While a specific development methodology isn't explicitly named, the detailed design documents and the high quality of the code (as noted in the previous assessment) imply a robust and systematic development approach."

      "comment": "The `Test & Validation.xlsx` provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to testing. It includes detailed functional test cases with clear steps, expected results, and recorded outcomes, demonstrating thorough validation of core features. Furthermore, dedicated sheets for performance analysis cover critical AR aspects such as tracking stability, rendering efficiency (frame rate), and system resource usage (CPU, GPU, RAM, battery), providing valuable quantitative data. Evidence of user testing, including ratings and qualitative feedback, is also present. This reflects an excellent effort in testing and validation."

      "comment": "The `Asset Register.xlsx` demonstrates excellent asset management. It provides a comprehensive and well-organized inventory of all project assets, including 3D models, UI elements, fonts, audio, and scripts. Crucially, it documents the source, licensing, and specific file paths within the Unity project, strongly indicating a proper and logical file structure. This thorough documentation is highly commendable and ensures traceability and maintainability of all supporting assets."
