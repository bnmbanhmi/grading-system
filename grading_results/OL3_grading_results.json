    "comment": "The video effectively showcases the prototype's key features, including AR interactive controls, core gameplay, winning states, and post-win social media integration. The real-world demonstrations of the AR functionality are clear, and the inclusion of development environment shots provides good context. While overall production quality is good, there are minor instances of glare/reflection on the phone screen and some text overlay readability issues due to color choices. However, the comprehensive demonstration of functionality makes this an engaging and informative presentation."

    "comment": "The coding quality is excellent across all provided files. The code is consistently well-structured, highly readable, and demonstrates a strong adherence to best practices in Unity development.\n\n**Strengths observed:**\n\n*   **Modularity and Single Responsibility:** Most scripts are highly modular, focusing on a single responsibility or a tightly-knit set of related functionalities (e.g., `ScreenshotManager`, `ClawController`, `ObjectSpawner`). This promotes maintainability and reusability.\n*   **Readability:** Naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes/methods, k_ prefix for constants, s_ for static readonly fields) are consistently applied. `[Header]` and `[Tooltip]` attributes are used extensively, which is excellent for Inspector clarity.\n*   **Comments:** Comments are clear, concise, and used effectively to explain the purpose of classes, methods, complex logic sections, and important variables.\n*   **Best Practices:**\n    *   **Resource Management:** Proper use of `OnDestroy` for cleanup (e.g., `ScreenshotManager`, `TakePhotos`, `SelfieCameraSystem`).\n    *   **Performance:** Efficient practices like caching components (`GetComponent`), using `Shader.PropertyToID`, and pre-allocating list capacity are evident.\n    *   **Error Handling:** Robust error logging (`Debug.LogError`, `Debug.LogWarning`) and null checks prevent common runtime issues.\n    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Correct usage of Coroutines (`IEnumerator`) for timed actions and frame-dependent operations (`yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame()`).\n    *   **Input System Integration:** Modern Unity Input System is used effectively with proper event subscriptions and reader patterns.\n    *   **Editor Scripting:** Excellent examples of custom Editors, Property Drawers, and `InitializeOnLoadMethod` (e.g., `MaterialPipelineHandler`, `ARStarterAssetsSampleProjectValidation`, `StarterAssetsSampleProjectValidation`), significantly improving developer workflow and project validation.\n    *   **Platform-Specific Code:** Correct use of `#if UNITY_ANDROID` and `#if AR_FOUNDATION_PRESENT` for platform and package dependency management.\n    *   **Unity Component Design:** Code aligns well with Unity's component-based architecture, making intelligent use of `MonoBehaviour` and `ScriptableObject` where appropriate.\n*   **No Major Bugs:** No obvious functional bugs, logical flaws, or critical performance issues were identified in the provided code snippets. The functionality appears robust and well-considered.\n\n**Minor Considerations (not deductions):**\n\n*   Some scripts (e.g., `Drawer_Pull_Z`, `opencloseWindow`) use `OnMouseOver` and `Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)` which is a simpler interaction model, but for a basic drawer/window, it's functional. In a full XR application, an explicit XR interaction system would typically handle these.\n*   The `AotStubs.cs` file is auto-generated and therefore excluded from typical coding quality evaluation, as it's not manually written code.\n\nOverall, the code demonstrates a high level of professionalism and technical skill."

      "comment": "The 'OL3-Thaleah_Readme.pdf' and 'OL3-7009ICT Assignment 2 Presentation.pdf' provide an exceptionally comprehensive and well-structured overview of the project. Clear objectives are defined, followed by a detailed design process covering concept, UX, game mechanics, visual, and sound design. The development methodology explicitly outlines an Agile approach, detailing key stages from initial setup to deployment, and critically, includes a strong section on 'Challenges and Solutions'. This level of detail and foresight in addressing potential issues demonstrates a deep understanding of the project lifecycle and a thorough documentation standard."

      "comment": "The 'OL3-Thaleah_Readme.pdf' outlines a robust, multi-phase testing methodology encompassing Unit, Integration, System, Performance, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT). It includes a list of specific test cases and scenarios covering key functionalities like AR session stability, object placement, claw controls, and UI responsiveness. The documentation provides 'Validation Results' and 'Improvements Based on Testing', which actively demonstrates that testing was conducted and insights were used to refine the project. While specific quantitative metrics for performance could enhance this further, the comprehensive approach and evidence of user feedback are strong indicators of systematic quality assurance."
