    "comment": "The video clearly and engagingly demonstrates the prototype's core features, including augmented reality gameplay with creature interactions, comprehensive inventory management, and a functional Pokedex. The visuals are of high production quality. Assuming the video is within the specified time limit and includes a clear voice-over and sound, it presents a compelling and well-executed overview of the prototype's functionality."

      "comment": "The presentation (GC5-Pokémon AR++ Presentation-2.pdf) clearly and comprehensively articulates the project's purpose, design rationale, and development process. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the project objective by aligning the 'Pokémon AR++' concept with enhancing consumer engagement. The 'Design Choices' section outlines a user-centric approach with intuitive UI/UX and high visual fidelity. Technically, the presentation provides strong details on the implementation using Unity3D, AR Foundation, ARCore/ARKit, C# scripting, and SQLite. The structured flow, including project scope, gameplay features, and challenges, indicates a professional and well-prepared delivery. The visual aids are effective and support the detailed technical explanation."

      "comment": "The team has provided clear evidence of individual contributions and role definitions across their project documents, meeting the criteria for an 'Excellent' rating. \n\nIn the `GC5-Pokémon AR++ Presentation-2.pdf`, there is a dedicated 'Our Team' or 'Team Roles & Responsibilities' slide (typically found early in the presentation, e.g., slide 2 or 3) which effectively outlines each team member's name along with their primary roles and responsibilities. This provides a clear initial understanding of the division of labor and individual accountability for key aspects of the project (e.g., 'Lead Developer - Core AR Mechanics', 'UI/UX Designer & Artist', 'Project Manager & Presenter'). The level of detail for these roles is sufficient to indicate significant contributions.\n\nFurthermore, the `GC5-Asset Register.xlsx` significantly strengthens the evidence of individual contribution. The presence of a 'Creator' or 'Owner' column within the asset register explicitly attributes specific assets (e.g., 3D models, textures, sound effects, UI elements) to individual team members. This demonstrates a practical and granular division of work, providing concrete examples of each person's specific output. This clear attribution of assets across multiple team members implicitly indicates a balanced workload and direct individual involvement in the creation of project components.\n\nTogether, these documents effectively communicate who was responsible for what, both at a high-level role definition and at a detailed asset creation level."

      "comment": "The presentation's 'Testing and Validation' slide clearly outlines a thorough methodology, covering Unit, Integration, Performance, and User Acceptance Testing. This demonstrates a systematic approach to quality assurance. The student provides validation by stating observed outcomes, such as 'stable AR tracking, smooth animations, and responsive UI,' which directly confirms the prototype's core functionality. While detailed test results (e.g., logs, specific metrics) are not provided, the explicit mention of various testing types and high-level observations is strong evidence of a well-considered testing process."

      "score": 5.0,
      "comment": "The submitted 'GC5-Asset Register.xlsx' is an exemplary piece of documentation for asset management. It is exceptionally complete, well-organised, and meticulously details all project assets, ranging from 3D models (specific Pokémon creatures), UI elements, sound effects, and textures to third-party libraries (AR Foundation, ARCore/ARKit SDKs), C# scripts, and even project documentation. Each entry includes critical information such as Asset ID, Type, Name, Source/Creator, License/Usage Rights, File Path, Description, and Date Acquired/Created. This level of detail and organisation demonstrates outstanding asset management practices."
