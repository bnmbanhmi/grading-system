    "comment": "The video provides a clear and engaging presentation of the 'AR Room Customizer' prototype. The frames effectively demonstrate key features such as adding and placing items, changing item colors, and hints at wall/floor customization. The user interface is well-presented, and the visual quality of the AR rendering appears high. Assuming the video is within the time limit, includes a voice-over, sound, and features smooth transitions (as per instructions), it effectively showcases the prototype's core functionality."

    "score": 14.0,
    "comment": "The code exhibits excellent structure, readability, and adherence to best practices, particularly within Unity development (e.g., comprehensive XML documentation, `[Tooltip]` attributes, clear modularity between classes). However, a significant functional bug exists in `ObjectSpawner.TrySpawnObject`: if `spawnOptionIndex` is set to -1 (which is documented to enable random spawning), the method incorrectly returns `false`, effectively breaking the intended random object spawning feature. There's also a minor typo (\"Verticale\" instead of \"Vertical\") and some small redundancies (unused variable `m_IsInitialLoad`). While the overall code quality is very high, the presence of this major bug prevents it from reaching the 'Excellent' category."

      "score": 18.5,
      "comment": "The project documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the AR Room Customizer. The problem statement, proposed solution, and target audience are clearly defined, setting strong objectives. The design process is well-documented through the system architecture diagram and the breakdown of key features and technologies. The development methodology, following an Agile-like approach with a detailed timeline across four phases, is clearly articulated. Furthermore, the challenges encountered during development and their respective solutions are thoughtfully presented, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the project lifecycle. This submission exceptionally meets the criteria for excellent documentation of the project's description, design, and development process."

      "comment": "The student clearly articulates their role as 'Lead Developer & UI/UX Designer' and outlines their key responsibilities, including AR core implementation, object interaction, UI development, and overall system design. The documentation also includes a strong individual reflection on learning outcomes, highlighting deepened knowledge in Unity/AR Foundation, Agile practices, and UI/UX principles. This provides clear and well-documented evidence of individual contributions and personal involvement, fully meeting the criteria for an excellent assessment."

      "component": "Testing & Validation",
      "score": 9.0,
      "comment": "The documentation presents a comprehensive testing strategy, covering Unit, Integration, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT). It explicitly mentions performance metrics such as FPS, memory usage, and CPU load, along with the use of tools like Unity Profiler for analysis. Validation efforts include user feedback and A/B testing concepts. The inclusion of specific results (e.g., 'Stable AR tracking (Avg. FPS 50+ on test devices)', 'Low memory footprint (Avg. 150MB)', 'Positive user feedback on ease of use') demonstrates a systematic approach to validation and performance analysis. This submission provides strong evidence for an excellent testing and validation process."

      "component": "Supporting Asset Management",
      "score": 4.8,
      "comment": "Asset management is exceptionally well-handled. The presentation outlines sources for 3D models, textures, and UI elements, along with mentioning a structured folder organization and naming conventions. This is further substantiated by the provided 'Asset Register.xlsx' file, which is a highly comprehensive document. It systematically lists each asset with an ID, name, type, source, license/usage rights, explicit file path (demonstrating proper file structure), description, and date added. This level of detail and organization strongly indicates well-managed assets and comprehensive asset documentation, achieving an excellent standard."
